### Physics Debug Visualization

Physics Debug Visualiser allows you to quickly inspect the Collider
 geometry in your Scene
, and profile common physics-based scenarios. It provides a visualisation of which GameObjects
 should and should not collide with each other. This is particularly useful when there are many Colliders in your Scene, or if the Render and Collision Meshes are out of sync.

For further guidance on improving physics performance in your project, see documentation on the Physics Profiler.

To open the Physics Debug window in the Unity Editor, go to **Window** > **Analysis** > **Physics Debugger**.
