## Scene view

### Scene View Navigation
The Scene Gizmo has a conical arm on each side of the cube. The arms at the forefront are labelled **X**, **Y**, and **Z**. Click on any of the conical axis arms to snap the Scene view Camera to the axis it represents (for example: top view, left view, and front view). You can also right-click the cube to see a menu with a list of viewing angles. To return to the default viewing angle, right-click the Scene Gizmo and select **Free**.

You can also toggle **Perspective** on and off. This changes the projection mode of the Scene view between **Perspective** and **Orthographic** (sometimes called “isometric”). To do this, click the cube in the center of the Scene Gizmo, or the text below it. The Orthographic view has no perspective, and is useful in combination with clicking one of the conical axis arms to get a front, top or side elevation.
