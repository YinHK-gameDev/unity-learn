## Materials
In Unity, you use materials and shaderstogether to define the appearance of your scene.

To draw something in Unity, you must provide information that describes its shape, and information that describes the appearance of its surface. You use **meshes to describe shapes**, and **materials to describe the appearance of surfaces**.

> **Materials** and **shaders** are closely linked; you always use materials with shaders.
