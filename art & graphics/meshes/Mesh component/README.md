## Mesh components

### Mesh Renderer component
A Mesh Renderer component **renders a mesh**. It works with a **Mesh Filter component** on the same GameObject; the Mesh Renderer **renders the mesh that the Mesh Filter references**.

> To render a **deformable mesh**, use a **Skinned Mesh Renderer** instead.

In C# code, the **MeshRenderer class** represents a **Mesh Renderer** component. The **MeshRenderer class** inherits much of its functionality from the **`Renderer` class**. As such, this component has a lot in common with other components that inherit from **`Renderer`**, such as **Line Renderer**, and **Trail Renderer**.

**A: Materials**
- The Materials section lists all the materials that this component uses.

**B: Lighting** 
- The Lighting section contains properties that relate to lighting.

**C: Lightmapping** 
- he Lightmapping section contains properties **relating to baked** and **real-time lightmaps**.

**D: Probes** 
- The Probes section contains properties **relating to Light Probe** and **Reflection Probes**.

**E: Additional Settings** 
- The Additional Settings section contains additional properties.

### Skinned Mesh Renderer component
The Skinned Mesh Renderer component **renders a deformable mesh**. **Deformable meshes** include **skinned meshes** (meshes that have **bones and bind poses**), meshes that have **blend shapes**, and meshes that **run cloth simulation**.

> To render a regular mesh, use a **Mesh Renderer** and a **Mesh Filter** instead.


> When you add a deformable mesh or a model with a **deformable mesh to a scene**, Unity **adds a Skinned Mesh Renderer component to the resulting GameObject**.

In C# code, the **`SkinnedMeshRenderer` class** represents a **Skinned Mesh Renderer component**. The **`SkinnedMeshRenderer` class** inherits much of its functionality from the **`Renderer` class**. As such, this component has a lot in common with other components that inherit from **`Renderer`**, such as **Line Renderer**
, and **Trail Renderer**.

### Mesh Filter component

A Mesh Filter component **holds a reference to a mesh.** It works with a **Mesh Renderer
 component** on the same GameObject; the Mesh Renderer **renders the mesh that the Mesh Filter references**.

> To render a **deformable mesh**, **use a Skinned Mesh Renderer instead**. A **Skinned Mesh Renderer component** does not require a Mesh Filter component.

| Property: | Function: |
| --- | --- |
| Mesh | A reference to a mesh asset.To change the mesh asset that the Mesh Filter component references, use the picker (circle icon) next to the mesh’s name.Note: The settings for other components on this GameObject don’t change when you change the mesh that the Mesh Filter references. For example, a Mesh Renderer doesn’t update its settings, which might cause Unity to render the mesh with unexpected properties. If this happens, adjust the settings of the other components as needed.Corresponds to the MeshFilter.mesh property. |
