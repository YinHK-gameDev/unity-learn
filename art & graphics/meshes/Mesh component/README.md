## Mesh components

### Mesh Renderer component
A Mesh Renderer component renders a mesh. It works with a Mesh Filter component on the same GameObject; the Mesh Renderer renders the mesh that the Mesh Filter references.

> To render a **deformable mesh**, use a **Skinned Mesh Renderer** instead.

In C# code, the **MeshRenderer class** represents a **Mesh Renderer** component. The **MeshRenderer class** inherits much of its functionality from the Renderer class. As such, this component has a lot in common with other components that inherit from Renderer, such as **Line Renderer**
, and **Trail Renderer**.
