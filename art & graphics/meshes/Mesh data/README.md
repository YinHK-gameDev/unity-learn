## Mesh data

A **mesh** is defined by these properties:

- **Vertices**: **A collection of positions** in 3D space, with optional additional attributes.
- **Topology**: **The type of structure** that defines each face of the surface.
- **Indices**: **A collection of integers** that describe how the vertices combine to create the surface, based on the topology.


In addition to this, **deformable meshes** contain either:

- **Blend shapes**: Data that describes different **deformed versions of the mesh**, for use with animation.
- **Bind poses**: Data that describes the **"base" pose** of the **skeleton** in a **skinned mesh**.
