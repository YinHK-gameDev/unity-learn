## Mesh asset
A mesh asset represents a mesh in your Unity project.

Usually, Unity creates mesh assets when it imports model,

but you can also create mesh assets directly in Unity; for example, by creating a mesh with code and saving the results as an asset.

### Mesh Inspector

Select a **mesh asset** in the Project window to open the **Mesh Inspector**. 

This Inspector **displays information about the mesh**, such as the total number of vertices or the names of any blend shapes the mesh has. It also displays a visual preview of the mesh.

> The Mesh Inspector displays information about how the mesh asset stores
 its data, but not the values in the data itself.
