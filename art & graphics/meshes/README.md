## Mesh

A mesh is a collection of data that describes a shape. In Unity, you use meshes in the following ways:

- In graphics, you use meshes together with materials; meshes describe the shape of an object that the GPU renders, and materials describe the appearance of its surface.
- In physics, you can use a mesh to determine the shape of a colliderAn invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info

### What is mesh in modeling?
A mesh model consists of **vertices, edges, and faces that use polygonal representation, including triangles and quadrilaterals, to define a 3D shape**. Unlike solid models, mesh has no mass properties. However, as with 3D solids, you can create primitive mesh forms such as boxes, cones, and pyramids.
