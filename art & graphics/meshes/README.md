## Mesh

A mesh is a **collection of data** that **describes a shape**. In Unity, you use meshes in the following ways:

- In **graphics**, you use meshes together with materials; **meshes describe the shape of an object** that the **GPU renders**, and **materials describe the appearance of its surface**.
- In **physics**, you can use a mesh to **determine the shape of a collider**. An **invisible shape** that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a **rough approximation** is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. 

### What is mesh in modeling?
A mesh model consists of **vertices, edges, and faces that use polygonal representation, including triangles and quadrilaterals, to define a 3D shape**. Unlike solid models, mesh has no mass properties. However, as with 3D solids, you can create primitive mesh forms such as boxes, cones, and pyramids.

A 3D mesh is the structural build of a 3D model consisting of polygons. 3D meshes use reference points in X, Y and Z axes to define shapes with height, width and depth.

The polygons used are typically quadrangles or triangles; these geometric shapes can be further broken down into vertices in X, Y, Z coordinates and lines.

### Deformable meshes
(Deformable means that **capable of being reshaped**)

In addition to regular meshes, Unity also supports **deformable meshes**.

**Deformable meshes** fall into the following categories:

- **Skinned meshes**: \
  These meshes work with **additional data** called **bones**. **Bones** form a structure called a **skeleton** (also called a **rig**, or **joint** hierarchy), and the **skinned mesh** contains data that allows it to deform in a realistic way when the **skeleton moves**. You usually use **skinned meshes** for **skeletal animation** with Unity’s Animation features, but you can also use them with **`Rigidbody`** components to create **"ragdoll"** effects.
- **Meshes with blend shapes**: \
  These meshes contain data called **blend shapes**. **Blend shapes** describe **versions of the mesh** that are **deformed into different shapes**, which Unity **interpolates between**. You use blend shapes for **`morph target animation`**, which is a common technique for **facial animation**.
- Meshes that work with a **Cloth component** for realistic **fabric simulation**.


### Creating meshes

You can add meshes to a Unity project in the following ways:

- Create a mesh as part of a model
 in a 3D modeling program, then import it. **Unity creates a mesh asset as a part of the model hierarchy when you import a model**.
- Create a mesh directly with **in-Editor tools**. Unity has **built-in primitive** shapes such as **spheres and capsules** that you can place directly into a Scene. 
- You can also use a package like **ProBuilder** to model a custom mesh in the Editor.
- Create meshes with code, either at **runtime** or in the **Editor**.


### Working with meshes

Unity stores meshes in your project as **mesh assets**, and represents them in **C#** code with the **Mesh class**.

Depending on how you use meshes, they work with **different components**:

- In **graphics**, Unity **renders regular meshe**s with **Mesh Renderer components**, and **deformable meshes** with **Skinned Mesh Renderer components**.
- In **physics**, Unity uses the **Mesh Collider component** to **determine the shape of a collider**.
