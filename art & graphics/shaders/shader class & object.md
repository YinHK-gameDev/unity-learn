## The Shader class & its instance


### Shader object fundamentals

A Shader object contains shader programs, instructions for changing settings on the GPU (collectively called the render state), and information that tells Unity how to use them.

> You use **Shader objects with materials** to determine the **appearance** of your scene.

You can create Shader objects in two ways. Each has its own type of asset:
- You can **write code** to create a **shader asset**, which is a text file with the **`.shader`** extension.
- You can use **Shader Graph** to create a Shader Graph asset.
