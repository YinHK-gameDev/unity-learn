## Standard Particle Shaders


The Unity Standard Particle Shaders are built-in shaders that **enable you to render a variety of Particle System
 effects**. These shaders provide various particle-specific features that aren’t available with the Standard Shader.
 
 

To use a **Particle Shader**:

- Select the Material you want to apply the shader to. For example, you could apply a Flame Material to a Fire Particle System effect.
- In the Material’s Inspector, select Shader Particles.
- Choose the Particle Shader that you want to use, such as Standard Surface.
- Enable and disable the various Particle Shader properties in the Inspector.
