## Standard Shader
The Unity Standard Shader
 is a built-in shader with a comprehensive set of features. It can be used to render “real-world” objects such as stone, wood, glass, plastic and metal, and supports a wide range of shader types and combinations. Its features are enabled or disabled by simply using or not using the various texture slots and parameters in the material editor.
 
The Standard Shader is designed with hard surfaces in mind (also known as “architectural materials”), and can deal with most real-world materials like stone, glass, ceramics, brass, silver or rubber. It will even do a decent job with non-hard materials like skin, hair and cloth.
