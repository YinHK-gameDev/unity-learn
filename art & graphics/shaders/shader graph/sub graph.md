## Sub Graph

A **Sub Graph is a special type of Shader Graph**, which you can **reference from inside other graphs**. This is useful when you **wish to perform the same operations multiple times in one graph or across multiple graphs**. A **Sub Graph differs from a Shader Graph in three main ways**:

- Properties in the Blackboard of a Sub Graph define the input Ports of a Sub Graph Node when you reference the Sub Graph from inside another graph.
- A Sub Graph **has its own Asset type**. For more information, including instructions on how to make a new Sub Graph, see Sub Graph Asset.
- A Sub Graph **does not have a Master Stack**. Instead, it **has a Node called Output**.
For information about the components of a Sub Graph, see Sub Graph Asset.

The **Output Node defines the output ports of a Sub Graph Node when you reference the Sub Graph from inside another graph**. To add and remove ports, use the Custom Port Menu in the Node Settings tab of the Graph Inspector by clicking on the Sub Graph Output node.

### Subgraph Asset

The **Subgraph Asset** is a **new Asset type** introduced with the Shader Graph. A Subgraph Asset **defines a Subgraph**. This is **different to a Shader Graph**. You can **create a Subgraph Asset from the Project window from the Create menu via Subgraph in the Shader sub-menu**.

You can open the Shader Graph Window by **double clicking a Subgraph Asset** or by **clicking Open Shader Editor** in the Inspector when the Subgraph Asset is selected.
