## Shader graph

Modern video game development platforms such as Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot increasingly include **node-based editors** that can create shaders **without the need for actual code**.

**Shader Graph** enables you to **build shaders visually**. Instead of writing code, you create and **connect nodes in a graph framework**. **Shader Graph gives instant feedback that reflects your changes**, and itâ€™s simple enough for users who are new to shader creation.



Shader Graph is available through the **Package Manager window** in supported versions of the Unity Editor. If you install a **Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP)** such as the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** or the **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**, Unity **automatically installs Shader Graph in your project**.


### Creating a new Shader Graph Asset
After you configure an SRP, you can create a new Shader Graph Asset. **Right-click the Project window**, locate **Create > Shader** in the context menu, then **select your desired type of Shader Graph**.

The type of Shader Graph available is dependent on the render pipelines present in your project. Some options may or may not be present based on the render pipelines.
