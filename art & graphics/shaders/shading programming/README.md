## Shading programming

When you write shaders for Unity, you use the following languages:
- A programming language called **HLSL**. Use this to write the **shader programs** themselves.
- A Unity-specific language called **ShaderLab**. Use this to define a **Shader object**, which acts as a **container** for your shader programs. 

> You do not need to use different languages for different platforms; **Unity compiles your HLSL and ShaderLab code into different languages for different graphics APIs**. For more information, see [Shader compilation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-ShadingLanguage.htmlshader-compilation.html).

> **Note:** You can also directly write your shader programs in **GLSL and Metal** if you want. This is not recommended or needed as part of a normal workflow. For more information on using GLSL, see [GLSL in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-ShadingLanguage.htmlSL-GLSLShaderPrograms.html).
