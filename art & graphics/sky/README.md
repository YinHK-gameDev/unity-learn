## Sky
### Sky and render pipelines
The sky solutions you can use depend on which render pipeline your Project uses.
 
A sky is a **type of background that a Camera draws before it renders a frame**. 

The sky itself **can contain anything, such as clouds, mountains, buildings, and other unreachable objects**, to create the illusion of distant three-dimensional surroundings. Unity can also **use a sky to generate realistic ambient lighting** in your Scene.

 
| Render pipeline | Sky Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Built-in Render Pipeline | The Built-in Render Pipeline uses a skybox Material to define a sky for Cameras to draw. You can specify the sky on a per-Scene basis and also override the sky for an individual Camera.• For information on how to set the sky on a per-Scene basis, see the Lighting window documentation.• For information on how to override the sky for a specific Camera, see the Skybox component documentation. |
| Universal Render Pipeline (URP) | URP uses the same sky solution as the Built-in Render Pipeline and allows you to specify the sky on a per-Scene basis and override the sky for an individual Camera.• For information on how to set the sky on a per-Scene basis, see the Lighting window documentation.• For information on how to override the sky for a specific Camera, see the Skybox component documentation. |
| High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) | HDRP includes its own sky solution that uses the Volume system. Each Volume can include an override to specify a type of sky to draw. Each Camera interpolates between the sky settings for every Volume that affects it and draws the result.For information on how to create a sky in HDRP, see the Visual Environment documentation. |

### SkyManager

Unity includes a dedicated manager—the **SkyManager**—to ensure that **environment lighting affects your scene** **by default**.
 
> The **SkyManager** automatically generates an **ambient probe** and default **reflection probe** to capture **environment lighting**.


Unity **updates these probes each time environment lighting** in your scene changes, until **the moment you generate lighting**. After you generate lighting, Unity **bakes the current environment light values into the probes**.


When you specifically use the Generate Lighting control to manually bake your lighting, Unity stops updating the probes from that point onward and only updates them again at the next bake. If you **want Unity to continue to update the probes each time the environment lighting changes**, **enable the Auto Generate option**.

If you remove the Lighting Data Asset from your project, Unity continues to update the probes each time the environment lighting changes.


#### Disabling the SkyManager

To **prevent the environment contribution from automatically affecting the lighting result** for a scene or GameObject that does not have manually created light maps and Light Probes, **disable the default Reflection Probe and the ambient probe**.
 
 
 To disable these probes, navigate to **Window** > **Rendering** > **Lighting Settings** > **Environment**, then make one of the following changes:

-   Option 1: Set **Intensity Multiplier** to 0.
-   Option 2: Use a black **Skybox** 
-   Option 3: Set either the **Color** or **Gradient** for the **Source** to black.

#### Disable the SkyManager for all scenes

To prevent the environment contribution from automatically affecting the lighting result for all scenes, navigate to **Window** > **Rendering** > **Lighting Settings** > **Scene**, then disable **Recalculate Environment Lighting**.


### Skybox
A **skybox is a cube with a different texture on each face**. \
When you use a **skybox to render a sky**, Unity essentially **places your Scene inside the skybox cube**. Unity renders the skybox first, so the sky always renders at the back.
 
Similar to other sky implementations, you can use a skybox to do the following:

- **Render a skybox around your Scene**.
- **Configure your lighting settings** to **create realistic ambient lighting** based on the skybox.
- **Override the skybox** that an individual Camera uses, using the **skybox component**. 
 
**Notes:**

1. The **Built-in Render Pipelin**, and the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** both exclusively use skyboxes to render a sky. These skyboxes are Materials that use a skybox Shader.
2. The **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** does not support skybox Materials and instead includes multiple sky generation solutions.


> In Unity, a **skybox** is a Material that uses a **skybox Shader**.

**Notes:**

2. The **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** does not support skybox Materials and instead includes multiple sky generation solutions.


The **Skybox component** overrides the skybox that Cameras on the same GameObject
 draw. It gives you control over what skybox a Camera
 renders and is useful when you have multiple Cameras in your Scene
 and want to draw different skyboxes depending on the Camera.
 
 
### Creating a skybox Material
To create a new **skybox Material**:

1. From the menu bar, click **Assets > Create > Material**.
2. In the **Shader** drop-down, click **Skybox** then the **skybox Shader** you want to use.
3. You can now **fill out the properties on the Material** to set up the skybox. The properties available on the Material depend on the skybox Shader the Material uses.

> **Note**: Each skybox Shader has its own set of prerequisite Textures that differ in number and Texture format
. For information on the Textures a particular skybox Shader requires, see the documentation for that skybox Shader.


### Drawing a skybox in your Scene

After you create a **skybox Material**, you can render it in your **Scene**. To do this:

1. From the menu bar, click **Window > Rendering > Lighting** Settings.
2. In the window that appears, click the **Environment** tab.
3. Assign the skybox Material to the **Skybox Material** property.

> **Note**: This draws the skybox in the background of every Camera
 in your Scene. If you instead only want to draw the skybox for a particular Camera.
 
### Drawing a skybox for a particular Camera

If you only want to draw a skybox in the background of a particular Camera, use the **Skybox component**. When you **attach this component to a GameObject with a Camera**, it **overrides the skybox that the Camera draws**. To attach and set up the **Skybox component**:
 
1. Select a **Camera** in your Scene and view it in the **Inspector** window.
2. Click **Add Component > Rendering > Skybox**.
3. On the Skybox component, assign the skybox Material to the **Custom Skybox** property.
 

###  Using a skybox Material for ambient light settings

After you create a **skybox Material**, Unity can use it to generate **ambient lighting** in your Scene. To make Unity do this:

1.  Open the Lighting window (menu: **Window > Rendering > Lighting Settings**).
2.  Assign your chosen skybox to the **Skybox Material** property.
3.  Click the **Source** drop-down and, from the list, click **Skybox**.

You can also specify **when Unity updates the ambient lighting**. To do this, change the **Ambient Mode**. The two values are:

-   **Realtime**: Unity constantly regenerates ambient lighting for your Scene. This is useful if you alter the skybox at run-time
-   **Baked**: Unity only generates ambient lighting for your Scene when you click the **Generate Lighting** button at the bottom of the Lighting window. This is useful if **your skybox does not change during run-time** because it saves computational resources.



If your Skybox includes a **sun, moon, or other light** in it, set up a Directional Light that points in the **same direction as the light**. This makes it appear as though the light in your skybox creates shadows in your Scene. If there are multiple Directional Lights in your Scene, you can choose which Directional Light the Skybox uses. To do this:

1.  From the menu bar, click **Window > Rendering > Lighting Settings**.
2.  Click the **Scene** tab.
3.  Assign the **Directional Light** you want to use to the **Sun Source** property.

If you want to have **fog** in your Scene, match the fog color to the color of the skybox. This makes the fog **blend to the color of the Scene sky**. To do this:

1.  From the menu bar, click **Window > Rendering > Lighting Settings**.
2.  Click the **Environment** tab.
3.  In the **Other Settings** section, enable the **Fog** checkbox.
4.  Set the **Color** property to a color that suits your skybox. For this, you can use the ink dropper tool to select a color from the Scene.

### Skybox shaders

Unity provides multiple **Skybox** Shaders for you to use. Each **Shader** uses a different set of properties and generation techniques. Each Shader falls into one of the following two categories:

**Textured**: Generates a skybox from one or multiple textures. The source textures represent the view of the background from all directions. The Skybox Shaders in this category are:

-   **6 Sided**
-   **Cubemap**
-   **Panoramic**

**Procedural**: Does not use textures and instead uses properties on the Material to generate a skybox. The Skybox Shader in this category is:

-   **Procedural**


#### 6 Sided skybox
This **skybox Shader** generates a skybox from six separate Textures. Each texture represents a view of the sky along a particular world axis. To illustrate this, think of the Scene as being inside a cube. Each Texture represents one of the interior faces of the cube and all six combine to create a seamless environment.

#### Cubemap skybox
This **skybox Shader** generates a skybox from a single Cubemap Asset. This **Cubemap** consists of six square Textures and represents the entire view of the sky from every direction.
 
 
#### Panoramic skybox
To generate a skybox, the **Panoramic Shaderwraps** a single Texture **spherically** around the Scene.

> To create a Panoramic skybox, you need a **single 2D** Texture that uses **latitude-longitude (cylindrical) mapping**,

To make sure the Texture is 2D:

- In the **Project window**, select the **Texture**.
- In the **Inspector**, make sure the **Texture Shape** is set to **2D**.


> To generate the best ambient lighting, the Texture should use a **high dynamic range (HDR)**.

#### Procedural skybox
The **Procedural skybox Shader** does not require any input Textures and instead **generates a skybox purely from the properties set in the Material Inspector**.

**Properties**:

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Sun** | The method Unity uses the generate a sun disk in the skybox. The options are:  • **None:** Disables the sun disk in the skybox.  • **Simple:** Draws a simplified sun disk into the skybox  • **High Quality:** Draws a sun disk into the skybox. This is similar to the **Simple** sun disk, but with this mode, you can use **Sun Size Convergence** to further customize the appearance of the sun disk. |
| **Sun Size** | The size modifier for the sun disk. Larger values make the sun disk appear larger and setting this value to **0** makes the sun disk disappear. |
| **Sun Size Convergence** | The size convergence of the sun. Smaller values make the sun disk appear larger. This property only appears if you set **Sun** to **High Quality**. |
| **Atmosphere Thickness** | The density of the atmosphere. An atmosphere of higher density absorbs more light. Unity uses the Rayleigh scattering method to absorb light. |
| **Sky Tint** | The color to tint the sky to. |
| **Ground** | The color of the ground (the area below the horizon). |
| **Exposure** | Adjusts the sky’s exposure. This allows you to change tonal values in the skybox this Material generates. Larger values produce a more exposed, seemingly brighter, skybox. Smaller values produce a less exposed, seemingly darker, skybox. |

### Skybox component
The **Skybox component overrides the skybox that Cameras on the same GameObject draw**. It gives you control over **what skybox a Camera renders and is useful when you have multiple Cameras in your Scene** and want to draw different skyboxes depending on the Camera.
