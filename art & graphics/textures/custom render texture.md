## Custom Render Textures

**Custom Render Textures** are a special type of texture that allow you to **update a textur**e with a **shader**
. They are an **extension to Render Textures**. 

> You can use **Custom Render Textures** to create **complex simulations** like **caustics, ripple simulation for rain effects**, and **liquid splatters**.

The Custom Render Textures feature provides a scripting and Shader framework to help with complicated configuration like varying update frequency, partial or multi-pass updates.

To use this framework you need to assign a Material to the Custom Render Texture asset. Custom Render Textures require a compatible Material. For more information, see Writing a shader for a Custom Render Texture.

To assign a compatible material to a Custom Render Texture asset:

- Create a new Custom Render Texture asset.
- Assign a compatible **Material** to it in the Material property in the **Custom Render Texture** asset.
