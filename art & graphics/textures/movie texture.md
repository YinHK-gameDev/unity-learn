## Movie Textures

> **Note:** MovieTexture is due to be deprecated in a future version of Unity. You should use [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MovieTexture.html../ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) for video download and movie playback.

**Movie Textures** are animated **Textures**An image used when rendering a GameObject, Sprite, or UI element. Textures are often applied to the surface of a mesh to give it visual detail. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MovieTexture.htmlclass-TextureImporter.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MovieTexture.htmlGlossary.html#texture) that Unity creates from a video file.

To create a Movie Texture, place a video file in your projectâ€™s **Assets Folder**. Unity uses this video file in the same way as a regular [Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MovieTexture.htmlclass-TextureImporter.html).

Unity imports video files using Apple QuickTime. On Windows, you need to install Quicktime to import a video file. Download Quicktime from [Apple Support Downloads](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime). Unity supports the same file types as your QuickTime installation (usually **.mov**, **.mpg**, **.mpeg**, **.mp4**, **.avi**, **.asf**).
