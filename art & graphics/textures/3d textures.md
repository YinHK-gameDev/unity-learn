## 3D textures

A 3D texture is a bitmap image that contains information in three dimensions rather than the standard two. 3D textures are commonly used to simulate volumetric effects such as **fog** or **smoke**, to approximate **a volumetric 3D mesh**
, or to store animated textures and blend between them smoothly.
