## Importing textures

The **Texture Import Settings** window defines how Unity imports images from your projectâ€™s Assets folder into the Unity Editor.

To access this window, select the image file in the **Project window**. The **Texture Import Settings** window appears in the **Inspector**.

> **Note**: Some of the less commonly used properties are hidden by default. Expand the Advanced section in the Inspector window to view these properties.
