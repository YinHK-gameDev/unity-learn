## Importing textures

The **Texture Import Settings** window defines how Unity imports images from your projectâ€™s Assets folder into the Unity Editor.

To access this window, select the image file in the **Project window**. The **Texture Import Settings** window appears in the **Inspector**.

> **Note**: Some of the less commonly used properties are hidden by default. Expand the Advanced section in the Inspector window to view these properties.

There are several sections on the Texture Import Settings window:

**(A)** [Texture Type](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html#texturetype). Select the type of Texture you want to create.

**(B)** [Texture Shape](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html#textureshape). Select the shape and set properties specific to that shape in this area.

**(C)** [Type-specific and advanced settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html#advanced). Depending on what **Texture Type** value you select, extra properties might appear in this area. For more information, see the documentation on [Texture types](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.htmlTextureTypes.html).

**(D)** [Platform-specific overrides](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html#platform). Use the **Platform-specific overrides** panel to set default options and their overrides for a specific platforms.

**(E)** **Texture preview**. You can preview the Texture and adjust its values here.
