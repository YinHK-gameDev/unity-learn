## Streaming Virtual Texturing
> This feature is experimental and not ready for production use. The feature and documentation might be changed or removed in the future.


Streaming Virtual Texturing (SVT) is a feature that reduces GPU memory usage and texture loading times when you have many high resolution textures in your Scene
. It splits textures into tiles, and progressively uploads these tiles to GPU memory when they are needed.
