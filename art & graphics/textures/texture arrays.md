## Texture arrays

A **texture array** is a **collection of same size/format/flags 2D textures** that look like a single object to the **GPU**, 
and can be sampled in the **shader** with a **texture element index**. 

They are useful for implementing custom **terrain** rendering systems 
or other special effects where you need an efficient way of accessing many textures of the same size and format.
