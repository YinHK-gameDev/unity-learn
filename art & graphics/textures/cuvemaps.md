## Cubemaps
A **Cubemap** is a collection of six square textures that represent the **reflections on an environment**. 

The six squares form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each face represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down, left, right, forward and back).

> Cubemaps are often used to capture **reflections** or **"surroundings"** of objects

for example: **skyboxes** and **environment reflections** often use **cubemaps**.


### Creating Cubemaps from Textures
The fastest way to create cubemaps is to import them from specially laid out Textures.
