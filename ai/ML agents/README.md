## Unity Machine Learning  Agent

**The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit** (ML-Agents) is an open-source project that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. We provide implementations (based on PyTorch) of state-of-the-art algorithms to enable game developers and hobbyists to easily train intelligent agents for 2D, 3D and VR/AR games. Researchers can also use the provided simple-to-use Python API to train Agents using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or any other methods. These trained agents can be used for multiple purposes, including controlling NPC behavior (in a variety of settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release. The ML-Agents Toolkit is mutually beneficial for both game developers and AI researchers as it provides a central platform where advances in AI can be evaluated on Unity’s rich environments and then made accessible to the wider research and game developer communities.


### How Unity ML-Agents works

- **Integrate** \
  Integrate the ML-Agents Unity package.
- **Train** \
  Connect your integrated Unity project and start training the agents to learn the right behaviour. 
- **Embed** \
  When training is complete, embed the trained agent model back into your Unity project.
