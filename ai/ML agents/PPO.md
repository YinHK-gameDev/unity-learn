## PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

**ML-Agents** uses a **reinforcement learning technique** called **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**. PPO uses a neural network to approximate the ideal function that maps an agent's observations to the best action an agent can take in a given state. The ML-Agents PPO algorithm is implemented in TensorFlow and runs in a separate Python process (communicating with the running Unity application over a socket).
