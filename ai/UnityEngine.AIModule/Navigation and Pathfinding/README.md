## Navigation and Pathfinding
The **navigation system** allows you to create characters that can **intelligently move around the game world**, using **navigation meshes** that are created automatically from your Scene
geometry. 
 
Dynamic obstacles allow you to alter the navigation of the characters at runtime, while OffMesh links let you build specific actions like opening doors or jumping down from a ledge.
