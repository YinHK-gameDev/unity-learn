## Behavior Graph

A behavior graph is a hierarchical structure. It helps you create artificial intelligence (AI) in video games by enabling agents to dynamically transition between modular sets of tasks. This structure enables the composition of collections of simple tasks into complex, adaptive behaviors, facilitating the creation of sophisticated AI systems.

A **Behavior Graph** is a visual scripting system for AI, like Unity's **Behavior Graph tool** (similar to Unreal Engine's Blueprints).

-   It is more flexible than Behavior Trees.
-   Uses a **graph-based system** to design AI.

### **✅ Pros of Behavior Graphs**

✔️ **Visual Scripting** – No coding required.  
✔️ **Flexible** – Can combine FSM, BT, and custom logic.  
✔️ **Good for Animation & AI** – Great for blending animations with AI.

### **❌ Cons of Behavior Graphs**

❌ **Newer & Less Documentation** – Not as widely used as BT.  
❌ **Performance Issues** – Graph systems can be **slower than BT** in large-scale AI.
