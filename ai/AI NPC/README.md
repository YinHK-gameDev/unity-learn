Behavior Designer: https://opsive.com/assets/behavior-designer/

### **ðŸŸ¡ 1. Behavior Designer (Third-Party Asset)**

ðŸ›  **Tool:** Behavior Designer (by Opsive)  
ðŸŽ¯ **Best for:** Creating **decision-making AI** (like NPCs in FPS, RPG, Strategy games)  
ðŸ“Œ **Core Feature:** **Behavior Trees** (BT)

#### **ðŸ”¹ Key Features:**

âœ… Uses a **Behavior Tree** (BT) system to control NPC logic.  
âœ… **Drag-and-drop nodes** for tasks like "Patrol," "Attack," or "Flee."  
âœ… Supports **State Machines (FSM)** and **Utility AI**.  
âœ… Advanced **AI decision-making** (like enemy AI in a shooter).  
âœ… Works well with **NavMesh & animation systems**.  
âœ… **Best for complex AI behavior** (e.g., enemy AI, boss fights, dynamic NPCs).

#### **ðŸ”¸ Example Use Case:**

ðŸš€ Enemy AI in an FPS game that:

-   **Patrols an area**
-   **Detects the player**
-   **Decides to attack, hide, or run away**
-   **Searches for cover when taking damage**

**ðŸ‘€ Example Behavior Tree (BT) Flow:**  
ðŸ‘€ **See Player?** â†’ **Yes? Attack!** â†’ **No? Keep Patrolling.**

ðŸ“Œ **Similar to:** Unreal Engine's Behavior Trees.


### **ðŸŸ¢ 2. Behavior Graph (Unity Visual Scripting)**

ðŸ›  **Tool:** **Unity's Behavior Graph (Experimental)**  
ðŸŽ¯ **Best for:** Simple **state-based AI & animation logic**  
ðŸ“Œ **Core Feature:** **Graph-based visual scripting**

#### **ðŸ”¹ Key Features:**

âœ… **Built into Unity** (Experimental in newer versions).  
âœ… **More like a State Machine (FSM)** instead of Behavior Trees.  
âœ… Good for **basic AI & animation transitions**.  
âœ… Similar to **Animator Graph** but for AI.  
âœ… **Easier for beginners** but **less powerful than Behavior Designer**.

#### **ðŸ”¸ Example Use Case:**

**A simple NPC AI** that switches between:

-   **Idle â†’ Walk â†’ Run â†’ Attack** based on player distance.
-   **Fewer decision-making options than Behavior Designer.**

ðŸ“Œ **Similar to:** Unity's Animator Controller or PlayMaker.



### **âš¡Which One Should You Use?**

| Feature | **Behavior Designer** ðŸŸ¡ | **Behavior Graph** ðŸŸ¢ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approach** | **Behavior Tree (BT)** | **State Machine (FSM-like)** |
| **Best For** | **Complex AI decisions** (e.g., FPS enemies, boss fights, stealth AI) | **Simple AI state changes** (e.g., NPC movement, basic AI) |
| **Use Case** | AI with **advanced decision-making** (Attack, Hide, Flee) | AI with **simple state transitions** (Idle â†’ Walk â†’ Run) |
| **Customization** | More powerful (supports Utility AI, FSM, & BT) | More limited (FSM-like state changes) |
| **Complexity** | **More advanced, requires some learning** | **Easier, good for beginners** |
| **Performance** | **Efficient for complex AI** | **Lightweight for simple AI** |


### **ðŸ”¥ Which One Should You Pick?**

âœ” **If you need** **smart AI decision-making (e.g., FPS enemies, boss fights, stealth AI)** â†’ **Use Behavior Designer.**  
âœ” **If you need** **basic AI state transitions (e.g., NPC Idle â†’ Walk â†’ Attack)** â†’ **Use Behavior Graph.**
