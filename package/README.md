## Package 
A **package** contains features to **fit the various needs of your project**. This can include any core Unity features included during the Editor installation, or other packages that you can install as needed.

### Unityâ€™s Package Manager
In the Editor, you can access the Package Manager window through this menu: **Window > Package Manager**.

### Released packages
**"Released"** packages are packages that have undergone testing with a specific version of Unity, and all other packages released for that version. The package also contains complete and accurate documentation, an updated changelog, and valid licensing.

### Core packages
Core packages are similar to other Unity packages, except that they are bound to the Editor version and they never appear on the Unity package registry. This means that you cannot find them in the Unity Registry list context. And unlike regular Unity packages, their version number is typically 1.0.0, because core package versioning is fixed to the Editor version.

### Built-in packages
Built-in packages allow users to toggle Unity features on or off through the Package Manager. Enabling or disabling a package reduces the run-time build size.
