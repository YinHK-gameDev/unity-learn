## Creating custom packages

The Unity Package Manager is the official package management system for Unity. It does the following:

- Allows Unity to distribute new features and update existing features quickly and easily.
- Provides a platform for users to discover and share reusable components.
- Promotes Unity as an extendable and open platform.


You can use the Package Manager to define project dependencies, resolve package dependencies, download packages, add packages, and integrate content in your projects.
