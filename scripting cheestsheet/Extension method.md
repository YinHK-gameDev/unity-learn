## Extension method

ExtensionMethods

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

//It is common to create a class to contain all of your
//extension methods. This class must be static.
public static class ExtensionMethods
{
    //Even though they are used like normal methods, extension
    //methods must be declared static. Notice that the first
    //parameter has the 'this' keyword followed by a Transform
    //variable. This variable denotes which class the extension
    //method becomes a part of.
    public static void ResetTransformation(this Transform trans)
    {
        trans.position = Vector3.zero;
        trans.localRotation = Quaternion.identity;
        trans.localScale = new Vector3(1, 1, 1);
    }
}
```

  

SomeClass

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class SomeClass : MonoBehaviour 
{
    void Start () {
        //Notice how you pass no parameter into this
        //extension method even though you had one in the
        //method declaration. The transform object that
        //this method is called from automatically gets
        //passed in as the first parameter.
        transform.ResetTransformation();
    }
}
```
