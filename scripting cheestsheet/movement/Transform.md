## Transform
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html

### `Transform.Translate`
Moves the transform in the direction and distance of translation.
```cs
public void Translate(Vector3 translation);
```
```cs
  transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * Time.deltaTime);

```
```cs
public void Translate(Vector3 translation, Space relativeTo = Space.Self);
```

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Translate.html

### `Transform.Rotate()`

Use Transform.Rotate to rotate GameObjects in a variety of ways. The rotation is **often provided as an Euler angle** and **not a Quaternion**.

You can specify a rotation in world axes or local axes.

```cs
public void Rotate(Vector3 eulers, Space relativeTo = Space.Self);
```

```cs
public void Rotate(float xAngle, float yAngle, float zAngle, Space relativeTo = Space.Self);
```

```cs
public void Rotate(Vector3 axis, float angle, Space relativeTo = Space.Self);
```

```cs
public void Rotate(Vector3 eulers);
```

```cs
public void Rotate(float xAngle, float yAngle, float zAngle);
```

```cs
public void Rotate(Vector3 axis, float angle);
```

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Rotate.html

### `Transform.position`
The world space position of the Transform.


> **Note**: If updating the position(Vector3), entire vector3 needs to be assigned a new vector3/update instead of updating/assigning value to specific axis only.

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html


### `Transform.LookAt()`
Rotates the transform so the forward vector points at target's current position. For example: camera point at the target object.
```cs
public void LookAt(Transform target);
```

```cs
public void LookAt(Transform target, Vector3 worldUp = Vector3.up);
```
| Parameters | Descriptions |
| - | - |
| target | Object to point towards |
| worldUp | Vector specifying the upward direction |

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.LookAt.html


### `Transform.parent`
The parent of the transform.

Changing the parent will modify the parent-relative position, scale and rotation but keep the world space position, rotation and scale the same.

```cs
public Transform parent;
```

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-parent.html


### `Transform.SetParent`
Set the parent of the transform.

This method is the same as the parent property except that it also lets the Transform keep its local orientation rather than its global orientation. 

```cs
public void SetParent(Transform p);
```

```cs
public void SetParent(Transform parent, bool worldPositionStays);
```

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.SetParent.html

### `Transform.GetChild`
Returns a transform child by index.

```cs
public Transform GetChild(int index);
```

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.GetChild.html

### `Transform.Find`
Finds a child by name n and returns it.

If no child with name n can be found, null is returned. If n **contains a '/' character** it will **access the Transform in the hierarchy like a path name**.

> **Note**: `Find` does not perform a **recursive descend down a Transform hierarchy**.
> **Note**: `Find` can find transform of **disabled GameObject**.

```cs
public Transform Find(string n);
```

```cs
public Transform gun;
public Transform ammo;

//Finds and assigns the child named "Gun".
gun = player.transform.Find("Gun");

//Find the child named "ammo" of the gameobject "magazine" (magazine is a child of "gun").
ammo = gun.transform.Find("magazine/ammo");
```

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Find.html

### `Transform.TransformDirection`

Transforms `direction` from local space to world space.

This operation is not affected by scale or position of the transform. The returned vector has the same length as `direction`.

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.TransformDirection.html
