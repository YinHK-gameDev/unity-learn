### `Transform.Rotate()`

### `Transform.LookAt()`
Rotates the transform so the forward vector points at /target/'s current position. For example: camera point at the target object.

### `Transform.SetParent`
Set the parent of the transform.

This method is the same as the parent property except that it also lets the Transform keep its local orientation rather than its global orientation.
