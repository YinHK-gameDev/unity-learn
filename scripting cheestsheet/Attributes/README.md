## Attributes

Attributes are **markers that can be placed above a class, property or function in a script to indicate special behaviour**. 

Attributes are used in C# to convey declarative information or metadata about various code elements such as methods, assemblies, properties, types, etc.

Attributes are added to the code by using a declarative tag that is placed using **square brackets ([ ])** on top of the required code element. 

Attributes in C# similar to annotation in Java.

Unity provides a number of attributes which are listed in the API Reference documentation:
