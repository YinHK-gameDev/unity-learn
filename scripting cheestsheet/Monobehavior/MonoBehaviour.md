### Properties

| Properties | Descriptions |
| --- | --- |
| `destroyCancellationToken` | Cancellation token raised when the MonoBehaviour is destroyed (Read Only). |
| `runInEditMode` | Allow a specific instance of a MonoBehaviour to run in edit mode (only available in the editor). **By default, script components are only executed in play mod**e. By setting this property, the MonoBehaviour will have its callback functions executed while the Editor is **not in playmode**.|
| `useGUILayout` | Disabling this lets you skip the GUI layout phase. |


### Public Methods
