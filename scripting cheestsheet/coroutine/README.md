### Coroutine

A **coroutin**e allows you to spread tasks across several frames. It is like a function that has the ability **to pause execution** and **return control to Unity but then to continue** where it left off on the following frame.

In most situations, when you call a method, it runs to completion and then returns control to the calling method, plus any optional return values. This means that any action that takes place within a method must happen within a single frame update.
