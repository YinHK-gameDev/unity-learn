## Renderer
General functionality for all renderers.

A renderer is what makes an object appear on the screen. Use this class to access the renderer of any object, mesh or Particle System. Renderers can be disabled to make objects invisible (**`Renderer.enabled`**), and the materials can be accessed and modified through them (**`Renderer.material`**).
