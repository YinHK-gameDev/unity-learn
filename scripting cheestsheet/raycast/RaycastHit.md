## RaycastHit

|RaycastHit properties|Description|
| --- | --- |
| **articulationBody** | The ArticulationBody of the collider that was hit. If the collider is not attached to an articulation body then it is null. |
| **barycentricCoordinat**e | The barycentric coordinate of the triangle we hit. |
| **collider** | The Collider that was hit. |
| **colliderInstanceID** | Instance ID of the Collider that was hit. |
| **distance** | The distance from the ray's origin to the impact point. |
| **lightmapCoord** | The uv lightmap coordinate at the impact point. |
| **normal** | The normal of the surface the ray hit. |
| **point** | The impact point in world space where the ray hit the collider. |
| **rigidbody** | The Rigidbody of the collider that was hit. If the collider is not attached to a rigidbody then it is null. |
| **textureCoord** | The uv texture coordinate at the collision location. |
| **textureCoord2** | The secondary uv texture coordinate at the impact point. |
| **transform** | The Transform of the rigidbody or collider that was hit. |
