## `Raycast`
The **`Raycast` function** is useful for **creating connections between objects** in Unity.

> **Raycast** in Unity is a Physics function that **projects a Ray into the scene**, **returning a boolean value if a target was successfully hit**. When this happens, information about the hit, such as the distance, position or a reference to the object’s Transform, can be stored in a **Raycast Hit variable** for further use. To **fire Rays** into the scene, and check if it hits anything or not


- **Raycasting** is the process of **shooting an invisible ray from a point**, in a **specified direction** to detect **whether any colliders lay in the path of the array.**
- A **raycast** sends an imaginary **"laser beam"** along the ray from its origin until it **hits a collider**
 in the scene. 

Eg:
```cs

void FireRay()
{
    Ray ray = new Ray(transform.position, transform.forward);
    RaycastHit hitData;
    Physics.Raycast(ray, out hitData);
}
```


### How to use Raycast
The basic version of Raycast is made up of three different parts:
-   A **Ray** variable
-   A **Raycast Hit** variable
-   The **Raycast** function

#### Create a ray
A **Ray** is simply a **data struc**t in Unity that represents **a point of origin** and **a direction** for the **Ray to travel**. It **defines where a Ray will go**.

- The **origin** is the position in the world that the Ray will start from. 
- The **direction** property takes a trajectory in the form of a normalised Vector 3.

Eg:
```cs
// Creates a Ray from this object, moving forward
Ray ray = new Ray(transform.position, transform.forward);
```

```cs
// Creates a Ray from the center of the viewport
Ray ray = Camera.main.ViewportPointToRay(new Vector3 (0.5f, 0.5f, 0));
```

```cs
// Creates a Ray from the mouse position
Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
```

```cs
Ray ray;
void Update()
{
    ray = transform.position, transform.forward;
}
```

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Ray.html

#### Use the Raycast Hit variable
The **Raycast Hit** variable is a **data struct** that **stores information about Ray’s collision**.
It records information like where the hit happened in the world, what object did the Ray collide with and how far away it was from the origin of the Ray.

```cs
// Container for hit data
RaycastHit hit;

```
You can get **the position of the hit** in the world using **`RaycastHit.point`**:
```cs
Vector3 hitPosition = hit.point;
```

You also can get **the distance from the Ray’s origin to the point of impact** using **`RaycastHit.distance`**:
```cs
float hitDistance = hit.distance;
```

You can also get information about the **Collider that was hit**, such as its **`Tag`**.
```cs
// Reads the Collider tag
string tag = hit.collider.tag;
```

You could even use Raycast Hit to get a **reference** to an object’s **Transform**:
```cs
// Gets a Game Object reference from its Transform
GameObject hitObject = hit.transform.gameObject;
```

> Using a **Raycast Hit variable** with Raycast will store information about the first object that is hit by the Ray.

#### Use the Raycast function
While the **Ray** and **Raycast Hit variables** define where a **Ray will go** and how **information from hits will be stored**, they don’t do anything on their own.

To **fire Rays** into the scene, and check if they hit anything, you need **Raycast function** for help.


Raycast function:

- **`Physics.Raycast`**: \
  https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html
- **`Plane.Raycast`**: \
  https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/ScriptReference/Plane.Raycast.html
- **`Collider.Raycast`**: \
  https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.Raycast.html


Eg:

```cs
public static bool Raycast(Ray ray, out RaycastHit hitInfo, float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers, QueryTriggerInteraction queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);
```

### Visualise Raycast in the scene
> The **Debug** Class includes a function, **`Draw Ray`**, that allows you to **render a Ray** in the world.


```cs
public static void DrawRay(Vector3 start, Vector3 dir, Color color = Color.white, float duration = 0.0f, bool depthTest = true);
```

Eg:
```cs
Ray ray = new Ray(transform.position, transform.forward);

// Render a visible line using Draw Ray, passing in the same value
Debug.DrawRay(ray.origin, ray.direction * 10);
```
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Debug.DrawRay.html

#### `RaycastHit`
Structure used to **get information** back from a **raycast**.


#### `Ray`
Representation of **rays**.

A **ray** is an **infinite line** starting at **origin and going in some direction**.



### Ignore raycast in specific gameobject 

To make a **raycast ignore a GameObject**:
- you can **assign it to the Ignore Raycast layer**, or
- pass a **LayerMask** for another layer which does not contain the gameobject you want to ignore the ray to the **ray cast API** call.

If you **don’t pass a LayerMask to the ray cast API call**, Unity uses **`Physics.DefaultRaycastLayers`** which **matches every layer except Ignore Raycast layer**.

The **`Physics.Raycast` function** uses a **bitmask**, and **each bit determines if a layer is ignored by rays or not**. If all bits in the layerMask are on, the ray collides against all colliders. If the layerMask = 0, there are no collisions. All colliders ignore the ray.
