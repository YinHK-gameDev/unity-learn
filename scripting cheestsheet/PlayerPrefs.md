### PlayerPrefs

The **PlayerPrefs** class in Unity allows you to save basic data between gameplay sessions, such as options settings, that can be **saved and reloaded, even after a game has been closed.**

It works by storing a string, float or integer value to disk with a key, which is a text string thatâ€™s used to store and recall a preference.

For example, to save an integer, simply call the Set Int function of the Player Prefs class and pass in the key you want to use to retrieve it again.


> store value eg score in database
