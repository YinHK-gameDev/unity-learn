## Unity Scripting

 Unity allows you to create your own Components using scripts. These allow you to trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.

You can attach a script by dragging the script asset to a GameObject in the hierarchy panel or to the inspector
 of the GameObject that is currently selected.
