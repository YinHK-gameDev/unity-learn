## Event System

An EventSystem component is automatically created alongside your UI and contains several Input Modules. These modules are responsible for deciding how GameObjects in your UI respond to input â€” if a corresponding GameObject within your UI contains the same Input Module as the one in your EventSystem, it can be interacted with.
