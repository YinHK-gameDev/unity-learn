## Time

provide you with numeric values that allow you to measure time elapsing while your game or app is running.

- **`Time.time`** returns the amount of time in seconds since your project started playing.
- **`Time.deltaTime`** returns the amount of time in seconds that elapsed since the last frame completed. This value varies depending on the frames per second
 (FPS) rate at which your game or app is running.
