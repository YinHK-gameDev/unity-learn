## UnityEvents

### Using UnityEvents
To configure a callback in the editor there are a few steps to take:

- Make sure your script `imports/uses UnityEngine.Event``.

- Select the``+` icon to add a slot for a callback

- Select the UnityEngine.Object you wish to receive the callback (You can use the object selector for this)

- Select the function you wish to be called

- You can add more than one callback for the event
