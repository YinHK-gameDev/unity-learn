## EditorJsonUtility

Utility functions for working with JSON data and engine objects.

Whereas JsonUtility works for any MonoBehaviour or ScriptableObject-based object, EditorJsonUtility will work for any Unity engine type. So you could create a JSON representation of any object in the Unity Editor â€“ or go in the other direction and create an asset from a JSON file.
