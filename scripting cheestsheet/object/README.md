## Object class
Unity has a class in the UnityEngine namespace called Object, which acts as a base class for all objects that Unity can reference in the editor. Classes which inherit from `UnityEngine.Object` have special functionality which means they can be dragged and dropped into fields in the Inspector
, or picked using the Object Picker next to an Object field.
