## Object class
Unity has a class in the UnityEngine namespace called Object, which acts as a base class for all objects that Unity can reference in the editor. Classes which inherit from UnityEngine.Object have special functionality which means they can be dragged and dropped into fields in the Inspector
, or picked using the Object Picker next to an Object field.
