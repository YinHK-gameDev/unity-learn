## Rigidbody
Adding a Rigidbody component to an object will put its motion under the control of Unity's physics engine. Even without adding any code, a Rigidbody object will be pulled downward by gravity and will react to collisions with incoming objects if the right Collider component is also present.

The Rigidbody also has a scripting API that lets you apply forces to the object and control it in a physically realistic way.
