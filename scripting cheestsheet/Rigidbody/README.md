## Rigidbody
> Adding a **Rigidbody component** to an object will **put its motion under the control of Unity's physics engine**. 

Even without adding any code, a Rigidbody object will be **pulled downward by gravity** and will react to collisions with incoming objects if the right Collider component is also present.

The Rigidbody also has a scripting API that lets you apply forces to the object and control it in a physically realistic way.

### Comon use 

#### `Rigidbody.velocity`
The velocity vector of the rigidbody. It represents the rate of change of Rigidbody position.

#### `Rigidbody.position`
Rigidbody.position allows you to get and set the position of a Rigidbody using the physics engine.

#### `Rigidbody.rotation`
The rotation of the Rigidbody.

Use Rigidbody.rotation to get and set the rotation of a Rigidbody using the physics engine.

#### `AddForce`
Adds a force to the Rigidbody.
