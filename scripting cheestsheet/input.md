## Player input

> input must call the inputâ€™s methods in **update** function.

### `Input.GetAxis( string axisName )`
Returns the value of the virtual axis identified by axisName.

The value will be in the range **-1...1** for keyboard and joystick input devices.

The meaning of this value depends on the type of input control, for example with a joystick's horizontal axis a value of 1 means the stick is pushed all the way to the right and a value of -1 means it's all the way to the left; a value of 0 means the joystick is in its neutral position.

This is frame-rate independent; you do not need to be concerned about varying frame-rates when using this value.  
  
To set up your input or view the options for `axisName`, go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Input Manager**. This brings up the Input Manager. Expand **Axis** to see the list of your current inputs. You can use one of these as the `axisName`. To rename the input or change the positive button etc., expand one of the options, and change the name in the **Name** field or **Positive Button** field. Also, change the **Type** to **Joystick Axis**. To add a new input, add 1 to the number in the **Size** field.


```cs
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

// A very simplistic car driving on the x-z plane.

public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 10.0f;
    public float rotationSpeed = 100.0f;

    void Update()
    {
        // Get the horizontal and vertical axis.
        // By default they are mapped to the arrow keys.
        // The value is in the range -1 to 1
        float translation = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * speed;
        float rotation = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * rotationSpeed;

        // Make it move 10 meters per second instead of 10 meters per frame...
        translation *= Time.deltaTime;
        rotation *= Time.deltaTime;

        // Move translation along the object's z-axis
        transform.Translate(0, 0, translation);

        // Rotate around our y-axis
        transform.Rotate(0, rotation, 0);
    }
}
```
