## Visual Effect Graph

The Visual Effect Graph is a package that you can use to create large-scale visual effects for your Unity Project. 

> **Note**: The Visual Effect Graph simulates particle behavior on the GPU, which allows it to simulate many more particles than the Built-in Particle System.

If you want to create visual effects that include a large number of particles and need highly customisable behavior, use the Visual Effect Graph instead of the Built-in Particle System.
