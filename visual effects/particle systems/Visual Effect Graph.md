## Visual Effect Graph

The Visual Effect Graph is a package that you can use to create large-scale visual effects for your Unity Project. 

> **Note**: The Visual Effect Graph simulates particle behavior on the GPU, which allows it to simulate many more particles than the Built-in Particle System.
