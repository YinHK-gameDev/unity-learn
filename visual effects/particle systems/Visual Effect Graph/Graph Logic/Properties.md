## Properties

Properties are **editable fields** that you can **connect to graph elements using Property workflow**. 
They can be found on graph elements such as **Contexts, Blocks and Operators**.


**Properties are displayed on graph elements and will change their value accordingly to their actual value in the graph** : Connecting another property to a property slot will display the computed value of the connected property.

After disconnecting a connected property, the field reverts to the previously set property value.

### Property Nodes

Property Nodes are Operators that give access to Graph-Wide Properties defined in the Blackboard. These properties allow you to reuse the same value throughout the graph at different places.

> To create property node, you can drag the property from Blackboard to workspace

> You may use these property nodes to connect any contexts/blocks in the workspace.
