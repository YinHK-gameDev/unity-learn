## Visual Effect Graph

The Visual Effect Graph is a package that you can use to **create large-scale visual effects** for your Unity Project. 

> **Note**: The **Visual Effect Graph simulates particle behavior on the GPU**, which allows it to **simulate many more particles than the Built-in Particle System**.

If you want to **create visual effects that include a large number of particles** and need highly customisable behavior, use the **Visual Effect Graph** instead of the Built-in Particle System.


This visual node-based solution enables you to design visual effects, from simple common particle behaviors to complex simulations running on the GPU.

Available for PC, consoles, XR and high-end mobile, VFX Graph has been used in games such as [_V Rising_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7KTI94LzI8), [_Road 96_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5ZfH-fbqIQ), [_Hardspace: Shipbreaker_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWjn3MQHWC8), and _[Syberia: The World Before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4CIrBygieg)_

### VFX
The **VFX tab** in the **Project Settings** window controls settings **relevant to the Visual Effect Graph**.

This tab is **only visible if you install the Visual Effect Graph package**. For information on how to install the Visual Effect Graph

#### Using a Visual Effect Graph
Use a Visual Effect Graph to:

- Create one or multiple Particle Systems.
- Add static meshes and control Shader properties.
- Create properties to customize the instances you use in the Scene.
- Create events to turn parts of your effect on and off. You can then send these events from the Scene via C# or Timeline.
- Extend the library of features by creating sub-graphs of the Nodes that you commonly use.
- Use a Visual Effect Graph in another Visual Effect Graph. For example, you can reuse and customize a simple but configurable explosion in more complex graphs.
- Previews changes immediately, so you can simulate effects at various rates and perform step-by-step simulation. For instructions on how to install the Visual Effect Graph, see Getting started with Visual Effect Graph.
