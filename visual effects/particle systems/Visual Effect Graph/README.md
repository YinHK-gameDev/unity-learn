## Visual Effect Graph

The Visual Effect Graph is a package that you can use to **create large-scale visual effects** for your Unity Project. 

> **Note**: The **Visual Effect Graph simulates particle behavior on the GPU**, which allows it to simulate many more particles than the Built-in Particle System.

If you want to **create visual effects that include a large number of particles** and need highly customisable behavior, use the **Visual Effect Graph** instead of the Built-in Particle System.


This visual node-based solution enables you to design visual effects, from simple common particle behaviors to complex simulations running on the GPU.

Available for PC, consoles, XR and high-end mobile, VFX Graph has been used in games such as [_V Rising_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7KTI94LzI8), [_Road 96_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5ZfH-fbqIQ), [_Hardspace: Shipbreaker_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWjn3MQHWC8), and _[Syberia: The World Before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4CIrBygieg)_
