## Particle systems
A particle system **simulates and renders many small images or Meshes**, called particles, to produce a visual effect.

Each particle in a system represents an individual graphical element in the effect. The system simulates every particle collectively to create the impression of the complete effect.


Particle systems are useful when you want to create dynamic objects like fire, smoke, or liquids because it is difficult to depict this kind of object with a Mesh(3D) or Sprite(2D). Meshes and Sprites are better at depicting solid objects such as a house or a car.
