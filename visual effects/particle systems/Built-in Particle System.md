## Built-in Particle System

Built-in Particle System allows you to create effects for every platform that Unity supports. The Built-in Particle System simulates particle behavior on the **CPU** which allows for the following main benefits:

- You can use C# scripts to interact with a system and the individual particles within it.
- Particle systems can use **Unityâ€™s underlying physics system** and thus interact with **Colliders** in your Scene.
 
 The Built-in Particle System uses a component, so placing a Particle System in a Scene is a matter of adding a pre-made GameObject (menu: **GameObject > Effects > Particle System**) or adding the component to an existing GameObject (menu: **Component > Effects > Particle System**).
 
### Particle System modules

Because the component is quite complicated, the Inspector is divided into a number of collapsible sub-sections or modules that each contain a group of related properties.
