## Built-in Particle System

Built-in Particle System allows you to create effects for every platform that Unity supports. The Built-in Particle System simulates particle behavior on the CPU which allows for the following main benefits:

- You can use C# scripts to interact with a system and the individual particles within it.
- Particle systems can use **Unityâ€™s underlying physics system** and thus interact with **Colliders** in your Scene.
