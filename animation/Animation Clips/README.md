## Animation Clips
Animation Clips are one of the core elements to Unity’s animation system. Unity supports importing animation from external sources, and offers the ability to create animation clips
from scratch within the editor using the Animation window.
 
### nimation from External Sources

Animation clips imported from external sources could include:

- Humanoid animations captured at a motion capture studio
- Animations created from scratch by an artist in an external 3D application (such as Autodesk® 3ds Max® or Autodesk® Maya®)
- Animation sets from 3rd-party libraries (eg, from Unity’s asset store)
- Multiple clips cut and sliced from a single imported timeline.

### Creating a new Animation Clip

To create a new Animation Clip, select a GameObject in your Scene, and open the Animation Window (top menu:) **Window > Animation > Animation**.

If the GameObject does not yet have any Animation Clips assigned, the "**Create**" button appears in the centre of the Animation Window timeline area
