### Animation System

Unity has a rich and sophisticated animation system (sometimes referred to as ‘Mecanim’). It provides:

- Easy workflow and setup of animations for all elements of Unity including objects, characters, and properties.
- Support for imported animation clips and animation created within Unity Humanoid animation retargeting -the ability to apply animations from one character model onto another.
- Simplified workflow for aligning animation clips.
- Convenient preview of animation clips, transitions and interactions between them. This allows animators to work more independently of programmers, prototype and preview their animations before gameplay code is hooked in.
- Management of complex interactions between animations with a visual programming tool.
- Animating different body parts with different logic.
- Layering and masking features

### Create your animations
1.  In the scenes folder, locate and open ChallengeScene_Animation.
2.  Review the scene and consider the narrative you might be able to communicate through different animations.
3.  Identify several items that you can animate. You must create a minimum of five keyframed animations, but multiple animations can be on the same object, so long as you create an Animator Controller that will allow someone to see them all.
4.  Identify a character in the scene that you wish to animate. Source a minimum of three animations online or on the Unity Asset Store.
5.  Use either the AnimatorControllerTriggers script or the DanceParty script to control the animator with keystrokes.
6.  Create your keyframed animations and configure the Animator Controller as needed.
7.  Configure your imported animations for the humanoid animation system and add them to your selected character’s Animator Controller (they’re all using the SharedController Animator Controller from the previous tutorial).
8.  Once you’ve completed your animations, record a video showing them all off! 
9.  If you’d like to share your hard work with the community here on Learn, submit your video!
