### Animation System

Unity has a rich and sophisticated animation system (sometimes referred to as ‘Mecanim’). It provides:

- Easy workflow and setup of animations for all elements of Unity including objects, characters, and properties.
- Support for imported animation clips and animation created within Unity Humanoid animation retargeting -the ability to apply animations from one character model onto another.
- Simplified workflow for aligning animation clips.
- Convenient preview of animation clips, transitions and interactions between them. This allows animators to work more independently of programmers, prototype and preview their animations before gameplay code is hooked in.
- Management of complex interactions between animations with a visual programming tool.
- Animating different body parts with different logic.
- Layering and masking features
