## Key manipulation in Curves

**Curves** mode displays a resizable graph containing a view of how the values for each animated property changes over time. All selected properties appear overlaid within the same graph view. This mode allows you to have great control over viewing and editing the values, and how they are interpolated between.



In an Animation Clip
, any animatable property can have an Animation Curve, which means that the Animation Clip controls how that property changes over time. In the property list area of the Animation View (on the left), all the currently animated properties are listed. With the Animation View in Dope Sheet mode, the animated values for each property appear only as linear tracks, however in Curves mode you are able to see the changing values of properties visualised as lines on graph. Whichever mode you use to view, the curves still exist - the Dope Sheet mode just gives you a simplified view of the data showing only when the keyframes occur.

In Curves mode, the Animation Curves
 have colored curve indicators, each colour representing the values for one of the currently selected properties in the property list.
