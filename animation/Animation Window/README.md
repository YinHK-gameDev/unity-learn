## Animation

When you begin to animate various properties within this clip, the animated properties will appear here. If the animation controls multiple child objects, the list will also include hierarchical sub-lists of each child object’s animated properties. 
  
### The Animation Timeline
 
On the right side of the Animation View is the timeline for the current clip. The keyframes for each animated property appear in this timeline. 
The timeline view has two modes, **Dopesheet** and **Curves**. To toggle between these modes, click Dopesheet or Curves at the bottom of the animated property list area
  
- Dopesheet mode: \
  Dopesheet mode offers a more compact view, allowing you to view each property’s keyframe sequence in an individual horizontal track. This allows you to view a simple overview of the keyframe timing for multiple properties or GameObjects.  
  
- Curves mode: \
  Curves mode displays a resizable graph containing a view of how the values for each animated property changes over time. All selected properties appear overlaid within the same graph view. This mode allows you to have great control over viewing and editing the values, and how they are interpolated between.
  > Press **F** on the keyboard to zoom the view to the currently selected keyframes.

  > Press **A** on the keyboard to fit and re-scale the window to show all the keyframes in the clip, regardless of which ones are selected. 
  
  
### Time line
You can click anywhere on the Animation window time line to move the playback head to that frame, and preview or modify that frame in the Animation Clip. The numbers in the time line are shown as seconds and frames, so 1:30 means 1 second and 30 frames.
