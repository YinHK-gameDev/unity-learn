## Animation controller
When you have animation clips ready to use, you need to use an Animator Controller to bring them together. An Animator Controller asset is created within Unity and allows you to maintain a set of animations for a character or object.
 
 
The various ways an Animator Controller can be created:

- From the Project View by selecting `Create > Animator Controller`.

- By right-clicking in the Project View and selecting `Create > Animator Controller`.

- From the Assets menu by selecting `Assets > Create > Animator Controlle`.

This creates a `.controller` asset on disk. In the Project Browser window the icon will look like:

> Animator Controller assets are created from the Assets menu, or from the Create menu in the Project window.

The controller manages the various **animation states** and the transitions between them using a so-called **State Machine**
, which could be thought of as a kind of flow-chart, or a simple program written in a visual programming language within Unity.
