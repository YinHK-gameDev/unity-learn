## Root motion
Motion of character’s root node, whether it’s controlled by the animation itself or externally.

### Root node
A transform in an animation hierarchy that allows Unity to establish consistency between Animation clips for a generic model. It also enables Unity to properly blend between Animations that have not been authored “in place” (that is, where the whole Model moves its world position while animating).
