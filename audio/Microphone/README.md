## Microphone

The **Microphone** class is useful for **capturing input from a built-in (_physical_) microphone on your PC or mobile device**.

With this class, you can start and end a recording from a built-in microphone, get a listing of available audio input devices (microphones), and find out the status of each such input device.

There is no component for the Microphone class but you **can access it from a script**.
