## Audio 

Unity can import audio files in `AIFF`, `WAV`, `MP3` and `Ogg` formats in the same way as other assets, simply by **dragging the files into the Project panel**. Importing an audio file creates an **Audio Clip** which can then be dragged to an Audio Source or used from a script. 

For music, Unity also supports tracker modules, which use short audio samples as “instruments” that are then arranged to play tunes. Tracker modules can be imported from `.xm`, `.mod`, `.it`, and `.s3m` files but are otherwise used in much the same way as ordinary audio clips.
