## Audio Source
The **Audio Source plays back an Audio Clip(default) in the scene**. \
The clip can be **played to an audio listener** or **through an audio mixer**. 

The audio source can play any type of Audio Clip and can be configured to play these as 2D, 3D, or as a mixture (SpatialBlend).

The Source is like a controller for **starting and stopping** playback of that clip, and **modifying other audio properties**.

> Audio Sources don’t do anything **without an assigned Audio Clip**. 

> **Note**: You need to assign an audio clip as default audio in the Audio Source component

### Creating Audio Sources
- Import your audio files into your Unity Project. These are now Audio Clips.
- Go to **GameObject > Create Empty** from the menubar.
- With the new GameObject selected, select **Component > Audio > Audio Source**.
- In the Inspector, find the Audio Clip property on the **Audio Source Component** and **assign a clip**, either by dragging one from the Project Window or by **clicking the small circle icon** to the right of the Inspector property, then **selecting a clip from the list**.





| Property: | Function: |
| --- | --- |
| Audio Clip | Reference to the sound clip file that will be played. |
| Output | By default, the clip is output directly to the Audio Listener in the Scene. Use this property to output the clip to an Audio Mixer instead. |
| Mute | If enabled the sound will be playing but muted. |
| Bypass Effects | This is to quickly “by-pass” filter effects applied to the audio source. An easy way to turn all effects on/off. |
| Bypass Listener Effects | This is to quickly turn all Listener effects on/off. |
| Bypass Reverb Zones | This is to quickly turn all Reverb Zones on/off. |
| Play On Awake | If enabled, the sound will start playing the moment the scene launches. If disabled, you need to start it using the Play() command from scripting. |
| Loop | Enable this to make the Audio Clip loop when it reaches the end. |
| Priority | Determines the priority of this audio source among all the ones that coexist in the scene. (Priority: 0 = most important. 256 = least important. Default = 128.). Use 0 for music tracks to avoid it getting occasionally swapped out. |
| Volume | How loud the sound is at a distance of one world unit (one meter) from the Audio Listener. |
| Pitch | Amount of change in pitch due to slowdown/speed up of the Audio Clip. Value 1 is normal playback speed. |
| Stereo Pan | Sets the position in the stereo field of 2D sounds. |
| Spatial Blend | Sets how much the 3D engine has an effect on the audio source. |
| Reverb Zone Mix | Sets the amount of the output signal that gets routed to the reverb zones. The amount is linear in the (0 - 1) range, but allows for a 10 dB amplification in the (1 - 1.1) range which can be useful to achieve the effect of near-field and distant sounds. |
| 3D Sound Settings | Settings that are applied proportionally to the Spatial Blend parameter. |
| Doppler Level | Determines how much doppler effect will be applied to this audio source (if is set to 0, then no effect is applied). |
| Spread | Sets the spread angle to 3D stereo or multichannel sound in speaker space. |
| Min Distance | Within the MinDistance, the sound will stay at loudest possible. Outside MinDistance it will begin to attenuate. Increase the MinDistance of a sound to make it ‘louder’ in a 3d world, and decrease it to make it ‘quieter’ in a 3d world. |
| Max Distance | The distance where the sound stops attenuating at. Beyond this point it will stay at the volume it would be at MaxDistance units from the listener and will not attenuate any more. |
| Rolloff Mode | How fast the sound fades. The higher the value, the closer the Listener has to be before hearing the sound. (This is determined by a Graph). |
| - Logarithmic Rolloff | The sound is loud when you are close to the audio source, but when you get away from the object it decreases significantly fast. |
| - Linear Rolloff | The further away from the audio source you go, the less you can hear it. |
| - Custom Rolloff | The sound from the audio source behaves accordingly to how you set the graph of roll offs. |
