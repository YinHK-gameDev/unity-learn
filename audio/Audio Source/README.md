## Audio Source

The Source is like a controller for **starting and stopping** playback of that clip, and **modifying other audio properties**.

> Audio Sources donâ€™t do anything without an assigned Audio Clip. 

### Creating Audio Sources
- Import your audio files into your Unity Project. These are now Audio Clips.
- Go to **GameObject > Create Empty** from the menubar.
- With the new GameObject selected, select **Component > Audio > Audio Source**.
- In the Inspector, find the Audio Clip property on the Audio Source Component and assign a clip, either by dragging one from the Project Window
 or by clicking the small circle icon to the right of the Inspector property, then selecting a clip from the list.
