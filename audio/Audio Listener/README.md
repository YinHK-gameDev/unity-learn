## Audio Listener
The Audio Listener acts as a microphone-like device. It receives input from any given Audio Source in the scene and plays sounds through the computer speakers. For most applications it makes the most sense to **attach the listener to the Main Camera**.

If an audio listener is within the boundaries of a Reverb Zone reverberation is applied to all audible sounds in the scene.

When the Audio Listener is attached to a GameObject in your scene, any Sources that are close enough to the Listener will be picked up and output to the computerâ€™s speakers.

If the Sources are 3D, the Listener will emulate position, velocity and orientation of the sound in the 3D world, 2D will ignore any 3D processing.

> Each scene can only have one Audio Listener.
> You access the Project-wide Audio settings using the Audio window (main menu: Edit > Project Settings, then select the Audio category).
