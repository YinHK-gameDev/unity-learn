## Build & publish

### Reduce project complexity and size
- Only store assets/code in your repository
- Split your assets/code into smaller units, and put them in multiple Git or Nuget packages
- Export the terrain and maps, along with the necessary textures, to your final project.
- You have a huge library of textures and vegetation models and materials.
- you only export those to your level builder project (which may be separated from your prototype mechanics project, and so on).
