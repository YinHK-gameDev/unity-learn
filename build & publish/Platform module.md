## Platform module


If build for specific platform, eg: **Xbox, Playstation, Nitend**o, you are required to install Platform module. 

Each build must have a target platform. The Platform pane lists all the platforms you can build for.

Each version of Unity installed on your computer has its own platform list.

If the platform you need is not on the list, do one of the following:

-   In the **Build Settings** window:
    
    1.  Select the platform you want to add.
    2.  Select **Install** or **Download**.
-   In **Unity Hub** > **Installs**:
    
    1.  Select the three dots on the version of Unity you’re using.
    2.  Select **Add Modules**.
    3.  Follow the instructions to install the platform module.

To change the build’s target platform:

1.  Select the platform you want to switch to.  
    **Tip**: The list displays the Unity icon next to the platform currently selected as the target platform.
2.  Select **Switch Platforms**.  
    If Unity needs to re-import your assets in formats that match your target platform, the switch process can take a long time.
