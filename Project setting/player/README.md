## Player setting 
The **Player** settings window (menu: **Edit > Project Settings > Player**) contain settings that determine **how Unity builds and displays your final application**.  You can also use the **`PlayerSettings`** API to control most of the settings available in this window.

###  Platform-specific settings

The platform-specific settings are divided into the following sections:

-   **Icon**: the game icon(s) as shown on the desktop. You can choose icons from 2D image assets in the Project, such as **sprites**A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. 
-   **Resolution and Presentation**: settings for screen resolution and other presentation details such as whether the game should default to fullscreen mode.
-   **Splash Image**: the image shown while the game is launching. This section also includes common settings for creating a Splash Screen. 
-   **Other Settings**: any remaining settings specific to the platform.
-   **Publishing Settings**: details of how the built application is prepared for delivery from the app store or host webpage.
-   **XR Settings**: settings specific to **Virtual Reality (VR)**, **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **Mixed Reality (MR) applications**.
