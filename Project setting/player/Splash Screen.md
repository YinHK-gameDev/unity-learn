## Splash Image Player settings
The Splash Image section of the Player settings window (menu: **Edit > Project Settings > Player > Splash Image**) allows you to **configure a splash screen** for your project. The splash screen **displays when your application starts**.


However, the full customization of the splash screen is only available to those on [Plus, Pro, or Enterprise Unity plans](https://store.unity.com/compare-plans). \
If you’re on a **Personal Plan**, the following limitations apply to the Splash Image settings:

-   You can’t disable the **Show Splash Screen** setting to disable the splash screen
-   You can’t disable the **Show Unity Logo** setting to disable the Unity logo
-   The **Overlay Opacity** setting has a minimum value of 0.5

The Unity Splash Screen is the same across all platforms. It displays immediately while the first **Scene**A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.

See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsSplashScreen.htmlGlossary.html#Scene) of your application loads asynchronously in the background. However, if you use your own introductory screens or animations, this might take longer to appear because Unity has to load the entire engine and first Scene before it can display your own custom splash screen.
