## Splash Image Player settings
The Splash Image section of the Player settings window (menu: **Edit > Project Settings > Player > Splash Image**) allows you to **configure a splash screen** for your project. The splash screen **displays when your application starts**.


However, the full customization of the splash screen is only available to those on [Plus, Pro, or Enterprise Unity plans](https://store.unity.com/compare-plans). \
If you’re on a **Personal Plan**, the following limitations apply to the Splash Image settings:

-   You can’t disable the **Show Splash Screen** setting to disable the splash screen
-   You can’t disable the **Show Unity Logo** setting to disable the Unity logo
-   The **Overlay Opacity** setting has a minimum value of 0.5

The Unity Splash Screen is the same across all platforms. It displays immediately while the first **Scene** of your application loads asynchronously in the background. However, if you use your **own introductory screens** or **animations**, this might take longer to appear because Unity has to load the entire engine and first Scene before it can display your **own custom splash screen**.
