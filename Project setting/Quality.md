## Quality
Unity allows you to set the level of graphical quality it attempts to render. Generally speaking, quality comes at the expense of frame rate and so it may be best not to aim for the highest quality on mobile devices or older hardware since it tends to have a detrimental effect on gameplay. Use the Quality settings (menu: Edit > Project Settings, then select the Quality category) to select the Quality Level in the Editor for the chosen device. It is split into two main areas: the Quality matrix appears at the top; and below it, the settings for the active Quality Level appear.
