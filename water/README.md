## Water System in Unity
Create an ocean, lake, river, or pool in a few clicks

It’s now easy for environment artists to create and configure water surfaces – such as oceans, lakes, rivers, and pools – that will be integrated with other world and gameplay elements, like boats or seasides.

The first step is to activate water in your project:

-   Activate and configure water for each quality level (render pipeline assets for each quality level)
-   Activate water in the frame settings of your camera(s)
-   Activate water inside your scene with a Water Rendering volume override, which allows you to enable water rendering only when you need it depending on where your camera is

Once water is active, you are only a few clicks away from creating beautiful water bodies from the GameObject menu. HDRP provides three water surface types: pool, river, and ocean.
