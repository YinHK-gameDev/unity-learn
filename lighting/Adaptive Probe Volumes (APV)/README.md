## Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV)
Adaptive Probe Volumes make Light Probes
 easier to use by automating placement. They also provide higher quality, more accurate lighting, because they light per-pixel not per-object.

An Adaptive Probe Volume is a group of Light Probes
 that Unity places automatically based on the geometry density in your Scene
, to create baked indirect lighting. You can use Adaptive Probe Volumes instead of manually placing and configuring Light Probes.


### üåü Advantages of Adaptive Probe Volumes

- Unity samples surrounding probes **per-pixel** rather than per GameObject.  
  ‚Üí This results in **better lighting consistency** and **fewer seams** between adjacent GameObjects.
- You can **adjust Light Probe layouts** across a scene. For example, use a **denser set of Light Probes** in interior areas with more detailed lighting or geometry.  
- Adaptive Probe Volumes work well with **multiple scenes**.  
- They include **streaming functionality** to support **large open worlds**.
- You can update **light from the sky at runtime** with **sky occlusion** using **Adaptive Probe Volumes**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Adaptive Probe Volumes
- You **can‚Äôt adjust the locations of Light Probes** inside an Adaptive Probe Volume. \
  You can use **settings and overrides** to try to **fix visible artifacts**, \
  but it might not be possible to ensure Light Probes follow walls or lie exactly at the boundary between different lighting areas.  
- You **can‚Äôt convert Light Probe Groups** into an Adaptive Probe Volume.
