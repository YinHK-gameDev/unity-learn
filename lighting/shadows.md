## Shadows
In Unity, Lights can cast shadows from a GameObject onto other parts of itself, or onto nearby GameObjects.

Unity uses a technique called **shadow mapping** to render real-time shadows.

### Shadow mapping
Shadow mapping uses textures called **shadow maps**. Shadow maps are similar to depth textures. 

 A Light generates a shadow map in a similar way to how a Camera generates a depth texture.
