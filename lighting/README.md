## Lighting

a Light object is created by attaching a Light component to a GameObject.

Lights can be added to your scene from the **GameObject > Light** menu. You will choose the light format that you want from the sub-menu that appears. Once a light has been added, you can manipulate it like any other GameObject. Additionally, you can add a Light Component to any selected GameObject by using **Component > Rendering > Light**.

Lighting in Unity works by approximating how light behaves in the real world.


- **Direct light**:
  It is light that is emitted, hits a surface once, and is then reflected directly into a sensor (for example, the eyeâ€™s retina or a camera).
  
- **Indirect light**:
  It is all other light that is ultimately reflected into a sensor, including light that hits surfaces several times, and sky light. To achieve realistic lighting results, you need to simulate both direct and indirect light.
