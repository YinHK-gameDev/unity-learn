## Lighting

a Light object is created by attaching a Light component to a GameObject.

Lights can be added to your scene from the **GameObject > Light** menu. You will choose the light format that you want from the sub-menu that appears. Once a light has been added, you can manipulate it like any other GameObject. Additionally, you can add a Light Component to any selected GameObject by using **Component > Rendering > Light**.
