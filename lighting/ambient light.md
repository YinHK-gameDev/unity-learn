## Ambient light
Ambient light is light that is present all around the Scene and doesnâ€™t come from any specific source object. It can be an important contributor to the overall look and brightness of a scene.

Ambient light can  be useful if you need to increase the overall brightness of a scene without adjusting individual lights.

Ambient light settings can be found in the Lighting window.
