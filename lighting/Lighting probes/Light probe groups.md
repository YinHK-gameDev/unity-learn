## Light Probe Groups

To place Light Probes in your Scene, you must use a GameObject with a Light Probe Group component attached. You can add a Light Probe Group component from the menu: **Component > Rendering > Light Probe Group**.

Adding the **Light Probe Group** component to any GameObject in the Scene. However, itâ€™s good practice to **create a new empty GameObject** (menu: **GameObject > Create Empty**) and add it to that, to decrease the possibility of accidentally removing it from the Project.
