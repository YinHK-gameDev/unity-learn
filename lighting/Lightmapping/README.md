## Lightmapping

Lightmapping is the **process of pre-calculating the brightness of surfaces in a Scene** , and **storing the result in a Texture** called a **lightmap** for later use.



> The data baked into **lightmaps cannot change at runtime**. Real-time lights can be overlaid and used additively on top of a lightmapped scene, but cannot interactively change the lightmaps themselves.

**Unity provides the following lightmappers for generating lightmaps:**

- **Progressive Lightmapper**
- **Enlighten Baked Global Illumination**
