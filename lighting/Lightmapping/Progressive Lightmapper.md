## Progressive Lightmapper

The Progressive Lightmapper is a fast path-tracing-based lightmapper system that provides **baked lightmaps** and **Light Probes**
 with progressive updates in the Editor. It requires non-overlapping UVs with small area and angle errors, and sufficient padding between the charts.
