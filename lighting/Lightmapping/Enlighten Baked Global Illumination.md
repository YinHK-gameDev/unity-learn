## Lightmapping using Enlighten Baked Global Illumination
Enlighten Baked Global Illumination relies on precomputed real-time global illumination data to generate indirect lighting. This can be an advantage, because you can produce new lightmaps fairly quickly after changing the sceneâ€™s lighting. However, Enlighten Baked Global Illumination imposes more UV layout limitations than the Progressive Lightmapper.

Enlighten Baked Global Illumination is deprecated (unlike Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination).


### Using the Enlighten lightmapper

To use Enlighten Baked Global Illumination, go to **Window > Rendering > Lighting**, navigate to **Lightmapping Settings**, and **set Lightmapper to Enlighten**.

> You can perform many of the functions available in this window via scripts, using the **`LightingSettings`** API.
