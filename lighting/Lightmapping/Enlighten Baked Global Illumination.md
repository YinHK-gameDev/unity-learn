## Lightmapping using Enlighten Baked Global Illumination
Enlighten Baked Global Illumination relies on precomputed real-time global illumination data to generate indirect lighting. This can be an advantage, because you can produce new lightmaps fairly quickly after changing the sceneâ€™s lighting. However, Enlighten Baked Global Illumination imposes more UV layout limitations than the Progressive Lightmapper.

Enlighten Baked Global Illumination is deprecated (unlike Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination).
