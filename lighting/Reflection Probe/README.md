## Reflection Probes

Traditionally, games have used a technique called ***reflection mapping*** to simulate reflections from objects while keeping the processing overhead to an acceptable level. 

This technique assumes that all reflective objects in the scene can **see** (and therefore reflect) the exact same surroundings.

This works quite well for the gameâ€™s main character (a shiny car, say) if it is in open space but is unconvincing when the character passes into different surroundings; it looks strange if a car drives into a tunnel but the sky is still visibly reflected in its windows.




**Unity improves on basic reflection mapping** through the use of **Reflection Probes**, which **allow the visual environment to be sampled at strategic points** in the scene.

You should generally place them at every point where the appearance of a reflective object would change noticeably (**eg, tunnels, areas near buildings and places where the ground colour changes**).
