## Reflection Probes

Traditionally, games have used a technique called *reflection mapping* to simulate reflections from objects while keeping the processing overhead to an acceptable level. 

This technique assumes that all reflective objects in the scene can **see** (and therefore reflect) the exact same surroundings.

Unity improves on basic reflection mapping through the use of **Reflection Probes**, which allow the visual environment to be sampled at strategic points in the scene.

You should generally place them at every point where the appearance of a reflective object would change noticeably (**eg, tunnels, areas near buildings and places where the ground colour changes**).
