## Lighting Settings Asset
A Lighting Settings Asset represents a saved instance of the **`LightingSettings`** class, which stores data for the Baked Global Illumination and the **`Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination systems`**. The Unity Editor uses this data when it **precomputes lighting data for a Scene**
 that uses one or both of these systems.


> You can assign the same **`Lighting Settings Asset`** or **instance of the LightingSettings class to more than one Scene**, which makes it easy to share Global Illumination system settings across multiple Scenes.
