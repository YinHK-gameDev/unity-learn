## Lighting Settings Asset
A Lighting Settings Asset represents a saved instance of the **`LightingSettings`** class, which stores data for the Baked Global Illumination and the **`Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination systems`**. The Unity Editor uses this data when it **precomputes lighting data for a Scene**
 that uses one or both of these systems.


> You can assign the same **`Lighting Settings Asset`** or **instance of the LightingSettings class to more than one Scene**, which makes it easy to share **`Global Illumination system settings`** across multiple Scenes.


### Creating a Lighting Settings Asset
There are two ways to create a Lighting Settings Asset in the Unity Editor.

To create a Lighting Settings Asset from the Project view:

1. In the Project view, either click the add (+) button, or open the context menu and navigate to Create.
2. Click Lighting Settings. Unity creates a new Lighting Settings Asset in the Project view.


To create and automatically assign Lighting Settings Asset from the Lighting window:

1. Open the Lighting window (menu: Window > Rendering > Lighting).
2. Open the Scene tab.
3. Click **New Lighting Asset**. Unity creates a new Lighting Settings Asset in the Project view, and immediately assigns it to the active Scene.
