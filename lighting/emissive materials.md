## Emissive materials
"**Emission**" is a property of the Standard Shader which **allows static objects** in our scene to **emit light**.
 
Like area lights, emissive materials emit light across their surface area.

Example:

"**Emission**" is a property of the **Standard** **Shader** which allows **static objects** in our scene to emit light. 

> **Note**: Emission will only be received by objects marked as **Static** or **Lightmap Static** from the Inspector. Similarly, **emissive materials applied to non-static, or dynamic geometry** such as characters **will not contribute to scene lighting**.

Materials with an emission above zero will still appear to glow brightly on-screen even if they are not contributing to scene lighting.

> **Note**: **Emissive materials only directly affect static geometry** in your scene. \
> If you need **dynamic**, or **non-static geometry** - such as **characters**, to pick up light from emissive materials, **Light Probes**
 must be used.
 
### Set up emissive materials
In the **material inspecter**, check the **checkbox and change its color in emission field**.
Open **Lighting window**, click generating lighting.
