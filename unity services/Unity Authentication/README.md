## Unity Authentication

Apps typically need to know the identity of a player to provide a variety of features and services to both game developers and players to ensure security, consistency, and safety with every interaction. Unity Authentication provides anonymous and platform-specific authentication solutions for supported platforms, including mobile and PC.

Anonymous access doesn't require the player to enter sign-in credentials or create a player profile, but access through a platform requires sign-in credentials. Unity provides authentication through SDK and API calls, enabling game developers to focus on doing what they do best - creating games.


Unity Authentication easily integrates with the following Unity gaming services:

-   Analytics
-   Cloud Code
-   Cloud Content Delivery
-   Cloud Save
-   Economy
-   Lobby
-   Matchmaker
-   Relay
-   Remote Config
-   Vivox
