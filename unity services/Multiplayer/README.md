### Lobby
Lobby allows your players to connect before or during a game session. Players create public lobbies using simple game attributes which other players can then search, discover, and join. Invite-only lobbies also allow players to create private spaces for select participants only.

### Netcode for GameObjects
**Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode)** is a **high-level networking library** built for Unity for you to abstract networking logic. It enables you to send GameObjects and world data across a networking session to many players at once. With Netcode, you can focus on building your game instead of low-level protocols and networking frameworks.
