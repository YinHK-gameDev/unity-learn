## Friends
Add a new social experience to your games by helping players connect with others across any platform.

The Friends service is a building block for your game's community, enabling your players to form lasting relationships with people they meet in-game.

Friends allows your players to connect with others by sending and receiving friend requests, accepting or ignoring those requests, and then viewing and managing their Friends list in-game.
