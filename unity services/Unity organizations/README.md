## Unity Organizations
Unity Organizations are the **containers for your Projects and subscriptions**. If you are an individual game developer, you might not need to work with the features provided by an Organization.


Organizations are one way in which a **collection of users can collaborate on Unity projects**. An Organization can consist of a single user, and expand to include multiple users at a later time. You can associate multiple Organizations with your account.
