## Unity Environments
Environments are logical partitions for Unity Game Services that contain data associated with your project. Examples can include game code using Cloud Code, or game configurations using Remote Config.


-   Environments are isolated. This means that if you change data in one environment, data in other environments is not affected.
-   You apply Environments at the project level.
-   You can think of Environments as namespaces or labels for your data.
-   Creating an environment doesn't provision resources; it enables you to tie data to a specific workspace.

### Managing environments

To access a projectâ€™s Environments from the [Unity Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/):

1.  Select **Projects** from the primary navigation menu.
2.  Select the project to which you want to apply Environments from the project drop-down menu.
3.  Select **Environments** from the secondary navigation menu.

All projects start with a production environment. You can create up to 25 environments. To create a new environment, click **Add Environment**, give the new environment a name, and click **Create**.
