###  Cloud Content Delivery (CCD)
**Cloud Content Delivery (CCD)** is Unity's managed cloud service that **hosts and delivers content to your applicationâ€™s users worldwide without having to reinstall a new version of the application**.

Cloud Content Delivery is an end-to-end service for live game updates combining powerful asset management, cloud storage, and a reliable content delivery network (CDN).

Cloud Content Delivery allows you to quickly release game updates via the cloud 

With Cloud Content Delivery, you can build and release game updates with powerful asset management and content delivery via the cloud.

There are multiple ways to integrate your application content with Cloud Content Delivery (CCD):

- The **command-line interface (CLI)** is the **recommended interface** for interacting with CCD because it is the main mechanism by which you would upload content into a bucket (you can also upload content using the dashboard or the API).

- The **Dashboard** provides the same functionality as the CLI. \

- The **Content Delivery Management API** and **Content Delivery Client API** allow you to manage application content through **programming**.
