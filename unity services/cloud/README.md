### Unity DevOps
Unity DevOps is a group of tools and workflows that can help you develop games more rapidly and keep your projects secure.

Unity DevOps includes:

-   **Version control**: Boost collaboration with optimized workflows for artists and programmers alike, plus gain superior speed when working with large files and binaries.
-   **CI/CD**: Deliver high-quality games to market faster with automation for performance and multi-platform builds in the cloud or on-prem.

###  Cloud Content Delivery (CCD)
**Cloud Content Delivery (CCD)** is Unity's managed cloud service that **hosts and delivers content to your applicationâ€™s users worldwide without having to reinstall a new version of the application**.

Cloud Content Delivery is an end-to-end service for live game updates combining powerful asset management, cloud storage, and a reliable content delivery network (CDN).

There are multiple ways to integrate your application content with Cloud Content Delivery (CCD):

- The **command-line interface (CLI)** is the **recommended interface** for interacting with CCD because it is the main mechanism by which you would upload content into a bucket (you can also upload content using the dashboard or the API).
- The **Dashboard** provides the same functionality as the CLI.
- The **Content Delivery Management API** and **Content Delivery Client API** allow you to manage application content through programming.
- The **CCD Management SDK** allows you to manage your CCD content from inside the editor. This pairs with the Addressables package, and allows you to build and release from a single location.

#### How it work

- **Upload your content**: Upload and store content to the cloud by using our online dashboard, CLI, API, or in the Unity Editor.
- **Get organized**: Bucket and badge assets to easily identify and organize your content by using our asset management system.
- **Deploy to players**: Make sure the right players get the right content at the right time through our **content delivery network (CDN)**.


This demo game is built to teach developers how to use Content Cloud Delivery and the Addressable Assets package in a production-ready environment. \
