### Unity DevOps
Unity DevOps is a group of tools and workflows that can help you develop games more rapidly and keep your projects secure.

Unity DevOps includes:

-   **Version control**: Boost collaboration with optimized workflows for artists and programmers alike, plus gain superior speed when working with large files and binaries.

###  Cloud Content Delivery (CCD)
**Cloud Content Delivery (CCD)** is Unity's managed cloud service that **hosts and delivers content to your applicationâ€™s users worldwide without having to reinstall a new version of the application**.



There are multiple ways to integrate your application content with Cloud Content Delivery (CCD):

- The **command-line interface (CLI)** is the **recommended interface** for interacting with CCD because it is the main mechanism by which you would upload content into a bucket (you can also upload content using the dashboard or the API).
- The **Dashboard** provides the same functionality as the CLI.
- The **Content Delivery Management API** and **Content Delivery Client API** allow you to manage application content through programming.
- The **CCD Management SDK** allows you to manage your CCD content from inside the editor. This pairs with the Addressables package, and allows you to build and release from a single location.
