## Unity Build Automation
**Unity Build Automation** is our new name for **Cloud Build**. 

Unity Build Automation is a continuous integration that automatically creates multi-platform builds in the Cloud in minutes. You can point Build Automation toward your version control system to:


- Automate new builds
- Build faster
- Catch problems earlier
- Iterate on your builds more efficiently with agility

Build Automation supports most popular version control systems and builds for multiple platforms simultaneously, including iOS.


### What is CI/CD ?
**CI/CD**, or **continuous integration/continuous delivery or deployment**, is a software development practice enabled by **automation**. Frequent, reliable updates accelerate release cycles via continuous code delivery.

Continuous integration requires developers to frequently checkin/commit their units of code to a central shared repository many times a day.

### Unity’s Cloud Build service 
You can **build your project on your own computer**, or you can use **Unity’s Cloud Build service which provides automated build** generation and continuous integration for your Unity projects.


### How Build Automation works?
1. **SetUp**: Point Build Automation to your version control system.
2. **Trigger**: Commit a change to your project.
3. **Build**: On trigger, a build is automatically created.
4. **Deploy**: Your team is notified when the build is complete and ready to use.


## Unity build server
Build Server can scale your on-prem build capacity with on-demand or automated builds on dedicated network hardware.

Unity Build Server is a more cost-effective licensing solution for building Unity projects that helps studios iterate quickly and complete projects faster by offloading computationally expensive project builds to network hardware.
