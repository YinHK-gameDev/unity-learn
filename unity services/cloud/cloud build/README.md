## Unity Build Automation
Unity Build Automation is a continuous integration that automatically creates multi-platform builds in the Cloud in minutes. You can point Build Automation toward your version control system to:


- Automate new builds
- Build faster
- Catch problems earlier
- Iterate on your builds more efficiently with agility

Build Automation supports most popular version control systems and builds for multiple platforms simultaneously, including iOS.

### Unity’s Cloud Build service 
You can build your project on your own computer, or you can use Unity’s Cloud Build service which provides automated build generation and continuous integration for your Unity projects.
