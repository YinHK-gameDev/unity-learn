## Cloud Save
Cloud Save is a set of calls that allows storage of JSON snippets for a player of a game within an environment. You can use Cloud Save from your project in the Unity Engine, assuming you have linked your project and installed the required Cloud Save SDK.

Before using Cloud Save, you must complete an authentication flow for your player using Unity Authentication.

### Cloud Code integration
Using Cloud Code together with Cloud Save provides a powerful way to incorporate server-side code to update the player's state or to perform actions based on the playerâ€™s state.

To integrate **Cloud Save through Cloud Code**, see the **Cloud Code Services SDK** documentation.
