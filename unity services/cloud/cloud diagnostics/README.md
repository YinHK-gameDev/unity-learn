## Cloud Diagnostics
Unity Cloud Diagnostics is a suite of cloud-enabled tools that help collect and identify possible issues in your Unity-built game. Collect crash and exception reports as well as user feedback so you can better diagnose issues and ensure a smooth gameplay experience.

Cloud Diagnostics includes:

-   **Crash and Exception Reporting**: Automated exception and native crash reports along with the ability to add debugging symbol files.
-   **User Reporting**: Bug reports and user feedback directly from testers and the people using your app.
