### Unity Distribution Portal (UDP)
Unity Distribution Portal (UDP) lets you distribute your games to multiple app stores through a single hub. UDP repacks your Android build with each storeâ€™s dedicated In-App Purchase SDK to make your game compatible with the separate app stores. You can manage all your store submissions from the UDP console.
