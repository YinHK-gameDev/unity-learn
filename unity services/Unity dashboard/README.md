### Setting up your project for Unity services
To start using Unity services, you must first link your Unity project to a Project ID. You can create **a new Project ID** within the **Unity Editor**, or in the **Unity developer dashboard**.


To link your project from the Unity Editor:

1. Open the Services window (**Window > General > Services**).
2. Click **General settings** to open the Services section of the **Project settings** menu.
3. Select your Organization from the dropdown. You must be signed in to Unity Hub in order to view a list of associated Organizations.
4. Click **Use an existing Unity project ID** to link a project to an ID you previously created on the developer dashboard, or **Create project ID** to link your project to a new ID.
