## Remote config
Remote Config is a cloud service that you can use to tune your game design without deploying new versions of your application. It consists of a set of namespaced Key-Value parameters, and you can optionally define a set of values that override or add to these parameters.

This is **"dynamic settings configuration"**

With Remote Config, you can:

-   Adapt your game for different types of players.
-   Tune your game difficulty curve in near real time.
-   Alter graphic quality based on device to optimize performance.
-   Roll out new features gradually while monitoring impact.
-   Tailor game settings to different regions or other player segments.
-   Run Campaign tests to compare features such as colors, styles, and prices.
-   Turn on or off seasonal, holiday, or other time-sensitive events.
-   Enable or disable features for specific player segments or across the entire user base.
