## MLAPI
**"MLAPI"** stands for **"Mid-Level Application Programming Interface" (Mid Level API)**.

**MLAPI is a mid-level networking library built for the Unity game engine to abstract networking**. This allows developers to focus on the game rather than low level protocols and networking frameworks.
