## Multiplayer Component Reference

### Network Animator
The **Network Animator component** allows you to **synchronize animation states for networked objects**.
It synchronizes state and parameters from an AnimatorController.

The Network Animator ensures the synchronisation of GameObject animation across the network - meaning that all players see the animation happen at the same.

### Network Discovery
**Network Discovery** is a component that allows Unity applications using the **networking system to find each other** on a **local network (LAN)**.

The Network Discovery component does not require any integration with Unity services, and is intended as a fully stand-alone solution to finding other games on your local network to connect with.

### Network Identity
The **Network Identity component** is at the heart of the Unity networking high-level API. It controls a **GameObjectâ€™s unique identity on the network**, and it uses that identity to make the networking system aware of the GameObject.
