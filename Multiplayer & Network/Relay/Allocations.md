## Allocations
An allocation is a **request to the Allocations service from the host player to reserve space on a Relay server** for the host plus the number of players the host is expecting to join their game.

> After a player joins the host playerâ€™s allocation, they receive a **unique allocation ID**, and Relay **considers the player allocated**.


### Allocations service

The Allocations service is the entry point for interacting with the Relay service and enables players to create and join game sessions powered by Relay servers.
