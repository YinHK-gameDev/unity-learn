## Unity Relay
**Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode)** allows you to connect to a host by its IP and port. However, if the **host isn't on the same network as you** (for example, somewhere over the Internet), you will need some **extra services to achieve a successful connection** and, as a result, a successful game.

Unity Relay exposes a way for game developers to securely offer increased connectivity between players by using a join code style workflow without needing to invest in a third-party solution, maintain dedicated game servers (DGS), or worry about the network complexities of a peer-to-peer game. Instead of using DGS, the Relay service **provides connectivity through a universal Relay server** **acting as a proxy**.

**Using a Relay server**: \
The server is on the Internet with a **public-facing IP that you and the host can reach**. After **each side binds with the Relay**, they can **establish a connection and send data to each other via the Relay server**.

Relay **allows players to connect and enjoy immersive multiplayer gaming experiences - all without needing a dedicated game server.** Our service enables **easy and secure peer-to-peer communication between players**.

### What Is A Relay Server?
By default Sync does its best to establish direct connection between peers to achieve maximum speed. However, sometimes direct connection is not possible due to sophisticated NATs, firewalls, proxy servers, etc. that block Sync's port. In this case relay server will allow Sync to establish connection to other peers and transfer data without direct connection. This will impact the speed at which the files sync though. Files are synced to the relay server and passed over to other peers. Files are always encrypted and are not exposed to a third party server, relay cannot read them and they are not stored anywhere.

The Relay service facilitates multiplayer support without dedicated game servers by allowing players to communicate with each other through Relay servers. **Relay servers deliver messages between connected players using low-latency datagram exchange between game clients**, so no two players ever connect directly to each other. Relay servers are ideal for games that use a listen server pattern where one player (the host player) acts as the **"server"** and the other players (the joining players) act as **"clients"**.

The peer-to-peer client server model hosts games on the machine of a player, saving you the cost of renting or maintaining dedicated servers.

**Relay supports DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) encryption of all UDP communication to and from the Relay servers which enables users to deliver data that is authenticated and encrypted**.

### Get started with Relay

#### Set up a Relay project
**Relay is a PAYG (pay as you go) service** with a free tier. If you exceed the free tier monthly usage limit, you must enter payment information to keep full access to Relay and any other services.

1. Create a Unity Dashboard project.
2. Enable the Relay service.
    1.  From the Unity Dashboard, select **Multiplayer** > **Relay**.
    2.  Select **Set up Relay**.
    3.  Continue to the Relay **Setup guide** embedded in the Unity Dashboard.
3. Link your Relay project in the Unity Editor.
    1.  Open your project in the Unity Engine and navigate to **Edit** > **Project Settings**.
    2.  From the **Project Settings** window, go to the **Services** tab.
    3.  Select **Use an existing Unity project ID** and link to the Dashboard project displayed in the **Setup guide**.
    4.  After you the project links successfully, you're ready to move on to the next step of the integration process.
4. Install the Relay package.
    1.  In Unity, navigate to **Window** > **Package Manager**.
    2.  From the Package Manager, search or scroll to find the “Relay” package within the Unity Registry.
    3.  Select the package and click the Install button.
5. Check out **Simple Relay sample** to learn how to interact with the sample project.


#### Steps in using relay for connection

-   **Sign In (Anonymously)** uses Unity’s [Anonymous authentication](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/UsingAnonSignIn.htm) to sign into Relay. This generates a player ID.
-   **Get Regions** lists all the [regions](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/locations-and-regions) in which a [Relay server](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/relay-servers) is available.
-   **Create Relay** creates a Relay [allocation](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/allocations-service) and returns the host allocation ID.
-   **Get Join Code** generates a [join code](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/join-codes) for the host to share with other players.
-   **Join Relay** joins the Relay allocation and returns a player allocation ID.

https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/get-started


### Relay integrations

#### Lobby
The **Lobby service** allows you to connect players before or during a game session with public or private lobbies. You can use the **Lobby service** to group players together in a lobby before starting a game session or prevent connection loss if a host player becomes unavailable.

https://docs.unity.com/lobby/en-us/manual/unity-lobby-service

#### Authentication

You can use Unity Authentication to authenticate players with Unity services, including Relay.

https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/authentication

#### Unity Transport Package (UTP)
Relay leverages the Unity Transport Package (UTP) to offer a connection-based abstraction layer over UDP sockets with optional functionality like reliability, ordering, and fragmentation. You can use [Relay with UTP and NGO](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/relay-and-ngo), or [only UTP](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/relay-and-utp) if you prefer an alternative netcode library.

The Relay SDK works well with the Unity Transport Package (UTP), a modern networking library built for the Unity game engine to abstract networking. UTP lets developers focus on the game rather than low-level protocols and networking frameworks. UTP is netcode-agnostic, which means it can work with various high-level networking code abstractions, supports all Unity’s netcode solutions, and works with other netcode libraries.

#### DTLS encryption

**Relay supports DTLS encryption** of all **UDP communication** to and from the Relay servers.

Set the Relay server **connectionType** to **dtls** when creating an allocation as a host player to enable **DTLS encryption**.

The following code snippet has a function, AllocateRelayServerAndGetJoinCode, that shows how to use the Relay SDK to create an allocation, request a join code, and **configure the connection type as DTLS**.


```cs
public static async Task<(string ipv4address, ushort port, byte[] allocationIdBytes, byte[] connectionData, byte[] key, string joinCode)> AllocateRelayServerAndGetJoinCode(int maxConnections, string region = null)
{
    Allocation allocation;
    string createJoinCode;
    try
    {
        allocation = await RelayService.Instance.CreateAllocationAsync(maxConnections, region);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Debug.LogError($"Relay create allocation request failed {e.Message}");
        throw;
    }

    Debug.Log($"server connection data: {allocation.ConnectionData[0]} {allocation.ConnectionData[1]}");
    Debug.Log($"server allocation ID: {allocation.AllocationId}");

    try
    {
        createJoinCode = await RelayService.Instance.GetJoinCodeAsync(allocation.AllocationId);
    }
    catch
    {
        Debug.LogError("Relay create join code request failed");
        throw;
    }

    var dtlsEndpoint = allocation.ServerEndpoints.First(e => e.ConnectionType == "dtls");
    return (dtlsEndpoint.Host, (ushort)dtlsEndpoint.Port, allocation.AllocationIdBytes, allocation.ConnectionData, allocation.Key, createJoinCode);
}

```

### Use Relay with Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)
You **must configure your Unity project for Unity before using Relay with NGO**. Check out Get started with Relay. After you’ve enabled the Relay service and linked your Unity Project ID through the Unity Editor, you can **import the requirements**, set up the **`NetworkManager`**, **authenticate the player with Unity services**, and start working with the Relay SDK.

After setting up the Relay SDK, configure the game client to perform the tasks required to join a **Relay game session** as a **host player** and as a **connecting player**.

#### Import the requirements

Before using the Relay service, you **must import the Relay SDK and UTP along with other namespaces**. Use the **code snippet you generated from the Packages and SDK Download Center**.

1.  Sign in to the Unity Dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **Packages and SDK Download Center**.
3.  Select the following packages:
    - Relay    
    - Netcode for GameObjects   
4.  Select **Generate Code Snippet**, then follow the instructions.
    

The following code sample demonstrates an example of requirement imports.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using UnityEngine;
using Unity.Services.Core;
using Unity.Services.Authentication;
using Unity.Services.Relay;
using Unity.Services.Relay.Http;
using Unity.Services.Relay.Models;
using Unity.Netcode;
using Unity.Netcode.Transports.UTP;
using Unity.Networking.Transport;
using Unity.Networking.Transport.Relay;
using NetworkEvent = Unity.Networking.Transport.NetworkEvent;

```

#### Set up the NetworkManager
After installing the packages from the Unity Dashboard, set up the NetworkManager for Relay and NGO in your project from the Unity Editor.

-   Add a new **GameObject** to your scene.
-   Add the **NetworkManager MonoBehavior**.
-   In the **MonoBehavior Properties**, select the **UnityTransport** transport. After selecting UnityTransport, you’ll see a `MonoBehavior` called Unity Transport (script) at the bottom of the components list.
-   Set the **Protocol Type** of the new component to **Relay Unity Transport**.

#### Set variables and utility functions
You’ll also need to initialize some variables, such as the maximum number of connections and the join code.

```cs
const int m_MaxConnections = 4;

	public string RelayJoinCode;
```


#### Authenticate a player

You **must authenticate both the host player and the connecting players**. The simplest way to authenticate players is with the Authentication service's **`SignInAnonymouslyAsync()`** method. 

```cs
async void Example_AuthenticatingAPlayer()
{
    try
    {
        await UnityServices.InitializeAsync();
        await AuthenticationService.Instance.SignInAnonymouslyAsync();
        var playerID = AuthenticationService.Instance.PlayerId;
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Debug.Log(e);
    }
}
```

### Host player

When your game client functions as a host player, it must be able to **create an allocation, request a join code**, **configure the connection type**, and **create a Singleton instance** of the **`NetworkDriver`** to **bind the Relay server** and listen for connection requests from joining players.

#### Create an allocation and request a join code
The following code snippet has a function, **`AllocateRelayServerAndGetJoinCode`**, that shows how to use the Relay SDK to create an allocation, request a join code, and configure the connection type as [DTLS](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en-us/manual/dtls-encryption).

```cs
public static async Task<RelayServerData> AllocateRelayServerAndGetJoinCode(int maxConnections, string region = null)
{
    Allocation allocation;
    string createJoinCode;
    try
    {
        allocation = await RelayService.Instance.CreateAllocationAsync(maxConnections, region);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Debug.LogError($"Relay create allocation request failed {e.Message}");
        throw;
    }

    Debug.Log($"server: {allocation.ConnectionData[0]} {allocation.ConnectionData[1]}");
    Debug.Log($"server: {allocation.AllocationId}");

    try
    {
        createJoinCode = await RelayService.Instance.GetJoinCodeAsync(allocation.AllocationId);
    }
    catch
    {
        Debug.LogError("Relay create join code request failed");
        throw;
    }

    return new RelayServerData(allocation, "dtls");
}
```

#### Configure The transport and start NGO

The following code snippet has a function, **`ConfigureTransportAndStartNgoAsHost`**, that shows how to use the Relay SDK and NGO SDK to configure the transport and start NGO as a host player.


```cs
IEnumerator Example_ConfigureTransportAndStartNgoAsHost()
{
    var serverRelayUtilityTask = AllocateRelayServerAndGetJoinCode(m_MaxConnections);
    while (!serverRelayUtilityTask.IsCompleted)
    {
        yield return null;
    }
    if (serverRelayUtilityTask.IsFaulted)
    {
        Debug.LogError("Exception thrown when attempting to start Relay Server. Server not started. Exception: " + serverRelayUtilityTask.Exception.Message);
        yield break;
    }

    var relayServerData = serverRelayUtilityTask.Result;

    // Display the joinCode to the user.

    NetworkManager.Singleton.GetComponent<UnityTransport>().SetRelayServerData(relayServerData);
    NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost();
    yield return null;
}

```

### Joining player

When your game client functions as a joining player, it must be able to **join an allocation, configure the connection type**, and **create a singleton instance** of the **`NetworkDriver`** to **bind to the Relay server** and **send a connection request to the host player**.

#### Join An allocation

The following code snippet has a function, `JoinRelayServerFromJoinCode`, that shows how to use the Relay SDK to join an allocation with a join code and configure the connection type as [DTLS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MoQqubsoL5hzkx9JsDmLrZx9xaOBxjx9YPmwemNRhQU/edit#heading=h.h9iajtxrxw1h).

```cs

public static async Task<RelayServerData> JoinRelayServerFromJoinCode(string joinCode)
{
    JoinAllocation allocation;
    try
    {
        allocation = await RelayService.Instance.JoinAllocationAsync(joinCode);
    }
    catch
    {
        Debug.LogError("Relay create join code request failed");
        throw;
    }

    Debug.Log($"client: {allocation.ConnectionData[0]} {allocation.ConnectionData[1]}");
    Debug.Log($"host: {allocation.HostConnectionData[0]} {allocation.HostConnectionData[1]}");
    Debug.Log($"client: {allocation.AllocationId}");

    return new RelayServerData(allocation, "dtls");
}
```

#### Configure the transport and start NGO as a joining player

The following sample code demonstrates how to **configure the transport** and **start Netcode for GameObjects (NGO) as a joining player**.

```cs
IEnumerator Example_ConfigureTransportAndStartNgoAsConnectingPlayer()
{
    // Populate RelayJoinCode beforehand through the UI
    var clientRelayUtilityTask = JoinRelayServerFromJoinCode(RelayJoinCode);

    while (!clientRelayUtilityTask.IsCompleted)
    {
        yield return null;
    }

    if (clientRelayUtilityTask.IsFaulted)
    {
        Debug.LogError("Exception thrown when attempting to connect to Relay Server. Exception: " + clientRelayUtilityTask.Exception.Message);
        yield break;
    }

    var relayServerData = clientRelayUtilityTask.Result;

    NetworkManager.Singleton.GetComponent<UnityTransport>().SetRelayServerData(relayServerData);

    NetworkManager.Singleton.StartClient();
    yield return null;
}

```
