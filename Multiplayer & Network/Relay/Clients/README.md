## Clients
In the scope of Relay, there are two types of clients:

1. **Host client** - A host client is a game client of a host player. The target client is the target of a request from a joining client to join a game session on a Relay server.
2. **Joining client** - A joining client is a game client of a joining player. The joining client requests to join a host client on a Relay server for a game session.


### Disconnection

Disconnection is what happens when a joining player sends a DISCONNECT message to the host player. 

> This only disconnects the player from the host player in the game session. It **doesn't remove the player’s allocation from the Relay server**.

For a player to **deallocate from a Relay server (remove their allocation from the Relay server)**, they must send a **CLOSE message** to the Relay server. As a result, players must rebind to the Relay server through the connection flow after closing their connection.

In a typical game session, every player closes their own connection, with the host closing their connection last. Because the host player is the one who created the join code, closing their connection triggers Relay to:

- Release the host player’s allocation and the join code they created.
- End the host player’s connection to the Relay server.

When a player closes a connection, the Relay server updates all connected players to remove the disconnected player.

> Relay servers also disconnect players if the **connection times out**. You can prevent timeouts by keeping the connection alive.

### Client timeouts

Client timeouts, also called idle timeouts, occur when Relay disconnects a client from a Relay server **due to inactivity**. The default **time to live (TTL)** before Relay disconnects a client is **10 seconds**. The disconnect TTL is **60 seconds** when the **host is alone** (after the **BIND message** but before a peer connects to them with a **CONNECT message**).

A **timeout (controlled by a TTL value)** is a mechanism that limits the lifetime of idle connections to a Relay server. Relay uses a TTL to decide when a client times out from lack of network activity.

Because some game types might have a low message rate, such as turn-based strategy games, you might need to configure the game client to send **PING messages** to the Relay server to **keep the connection alive to prevent a timeout**. The **PING message** **resets the idle timeout** for a player connection.

> When an allocation expires through a client timeout, the **Allocations service** **removes the allocation** from the Relay server, which sends the client a **timeout error message**.

> **Note**: If an allocation times out, the Relay server responds with an **allocation ID** not found error. It's common for **allocation IDs** to expire due to a lack of **PING messages**.

### Keep a connection alive
Relay servers automatically disconnect clients after a period of inactivity.

For games with a **lower message frequency**, it’s important to **keep the connection alive** with a method that you regularly call, such as in the **`Update()`** loop.

> If you’re using **Relay with NGO**, the **network manager (NetworkManager)** **keeps the connection alive automatically**. However, it will only do so after you’ve successfully called **`StartClient`** or **`StartHost`**.

### Host migration(Relay host role transfer)

Host migration is the act of transferring the Relay host role from one player to another.

> **Note**: Relay doesn't have any method to migrate the host role when a host player disconnects from the Relay server. If the host player disconnects from the Relay server, Relay ends the host player’s allocation and disconnects the remaining players.

you can add custom logic to your game to migrate the Relay host role to another player if the original host player disconnects.

But you can add custom logic to your game to migrate the Relay host role to another player if the original host player disconnects.

The logic might include a workflow similar to the following:

1. Detect if the host player disconnects prematurely.
2. Place the remaining players in a **lobby**.
3. Select one of the remaining players to fill the host role.
4. Start a **new Relay allocation**.
