## Clients
In the scope of Relay, there are two types of clients:

1. **Host client** - A host client is a game client of a host player. The target client is the target of a request from a joining client to join a game session on a Relay server.
2. **Joining client** - A joining client is a game client of a joining player. The joining client requests to join a host client on a Relay server for a game session.


### Disconnection

Disconnection is what happens when a joining player sends a DISCONNECT message to the host player. 

> This only disconnects the player from the host player in the game session. It **doesn't remove the playerâ€™s allocation from the Relay server**.

For a player to **deallocate from a Relay server (remove their allocation from the Relay server)**, they must send a **CLOSE message** to the Relay server. As a result, players must rebind to the Relay server through the connection flow after closing their connection.
