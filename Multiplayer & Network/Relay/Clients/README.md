## Clients
In the scope of Relay, there are two types of clients:

1. **Host client** - A host client is a game client of a host player. The target client is the target of a request from a joining client to join a game session on a Relay server.
2. **Joining client** - A joining client is a game client of a joining player. The joining client requests to join a host client on a Relay server for a game session.
