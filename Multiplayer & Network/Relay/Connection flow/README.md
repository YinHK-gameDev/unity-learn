## Connection flow

### Player
There are two types of players:

- **The host player** \
  Host players are players who create a game session and then generate a join code to share with other players. There is only one host player per session. A host player receives its **connection data** after making an allocation request, which is then used to author a **BIND message**.
- **The joining players** \
  Joining players are players who receive the join code from the host player and then use the join code to join the game match. Joining players receive their own connection data, and the host's connection data, after making a join request using the join code. These connection data are used to request a connection to the host through the Relay server.


#### Maximum connections
The maximum number of players that can join and connect to the host in a session depends on the maximum number of connections configured by the host when they make the allocation request.

Players can leave at any time by sending a DISCONNECT message. Additional players can join the Relay server and connect to the host, as long as the number of connected players remains under the maximum allowed connections.

### Join codes

**Join codes are player-shared codes** that **allow players to group together into a logical game session**. Players can share these codes anyway they want, such as through a **Lobby**, **in-game chat**, or an **outside method such as chat service**.

> The join codes are case insensitive, simple, and short. This makes them easy to share, such as in situations where copy and pasting isn't available.

After a host player creates a game session, they then request a join code from the Allocations service to send to their friends. Their friends can then use the join code to join the host player's game session with their game client.

> Allocations and join codes are valid for as long as the host player is connected to the Relay server.

> Allocations and join codes are valid for as long as the host player is connected to the Relay server. If the host player disconnects from the Relay server, or if the connection times out, the allocation and join code become invalid. There is no way to explicitly invalidate a join code.


#### Generate a join code
You can **generate a join code** as the host player either with the **Relay SDK** or directly via the **Relay REST API**.


#### Use a join code to join a game
You can use a join code to **join a Relay server** as a joining player with the **Relay SDK** or the **Relay API**.
