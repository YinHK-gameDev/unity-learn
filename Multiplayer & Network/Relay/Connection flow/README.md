## Connection flow
The connection flow is the process by which the Allocations service reserves slots on a Relay server to group players into a match. The process involves two types of players: a host player and joining players.

**flow:** 
1. **The host player requests allocation**
2. **The Allocations service selects a Relay server** 
   > When the Allocations service finds a Relay server, it reserves a space on the Relay server for the game session. At this point, the Relay server also generates **a unique secret key**. The Relay server returns the **secret key** to the Allocations service, in addition to the **Relay server IP**, the **Relay server ports**, and the **connection data**.
3. **The Allocations service sends the connection data to the host player**
4. **The host player binds to the Relay server**
   > The host sends a **BIND message** to the selected **Relay server** using the data received from the response from the allocation request. The **BIND message** has the **connection data**, the** **accept mode, nonce, and HMAC**. If the host doesn’t send the bind to the Relay server within **60 seconds after making the allocation, the allocation **times out from inactivity**.
6. **The host player requests a join code**
   > **Once bound to the Relay server**, the host player can request a join code from the **Allocations service**.
8. **The Allocations service returns a join code to the host player**
   > The join code the Allocations service returns uniquely represents the host player’s allocation to the Relay server, and allows joining players to bind to the same Relay server and connect to the host player.
10. **The host player shares the join code with joining players**
11. **The joining players use the join code**
    > The host player shares the unique join code with other players through any method, including verbally, through a text message, or through a Lobby. The join codes are short and easy to remember to ease sharing. \
    > The players that use the join code with a join request to the Allocations service become the joining players. \
    > Any number of joining players can use the same join code so long as the number doesn't exceed the maximum number of connections specified in the initial allocation request.
13. **The Allocations service sends connection data to the joining player**
    > The **Allocations service** uses the join code to look up the host player’s allocation and returns the data to the joining players. \
    > The response from the Allocations service has the **Relay server IP address**, the **Relay server port**, the **secret key**, the **encrypted joining player’s connection data**, the **joining player’s allocation ID**, and the **encrypted host connection data**. The joining player can then use the **secret key** to **decrypt and use the host connection data to connect to the host**.
15. **The joining player binds to the Relay server**
16. **The joining player sends connection request**
    > The joining player sends a BIND message to the Relay server using its connection data it received from the response to the join request made to the Allocations service.


### Allocating
Allocating is when a host player tells the **Allocations service** about their intent to **connect to a Relay server**, and the Allocations service reserves slots on a Relay server.

### Binding
Binding is when the player establishes a connection with the Relay server that the Allocations service reserved for the player during the allocating process. After the player completes the binding process, the Relay server can discover the player’s IP address and exchange packets.

> A BIND is a specific message sent via the Relay protocol from the game client to the Relay server to establish its connection to the Relay server.
>
> **Note**: You typically send **BIND messages** after calling the allocate and join APIs, which retrieve the Relay server’s destination address for use with the **BIND message**.


### Joining 
Joining is when a joining player **joins the host player’s allocation on a Relay server**. After the joining player completes the joining process, they can exchange messages with the host player.

> Allocating and joining are similar processes. The primary difference is that the **join API response has the host connection data**. Note: A join is when a joining player (a non-host player) client joins the host client’s game session. Under the hood, it’s another allocate call to the Relay service.





### Player
There are two types of players:

- **The host player** \
  Host players are players who create a game session and then generate a join code to share with other players. There is only one host player per session. A host player receives its **connection data** after making an allocation request, which is then used to author a **BIND message**.
- **The joining players** \
  Joining players are players who receive the join code from the host player and then use the join code to join the game match. Joining players receive their own connection data, and the host's connection data, after making a join request using the join code. These connection data are used to request a connection to the host through the Relay server.


#### Maximum connections
The maximum number of players that can join and connect to the host in a session depends on the maximum number of connections configured by the host when they make the allocation request.

Players can leave at any time by sending a DISCONNECT message. Additional players can join the Relay server and connect to the host, as long as the number of connected players remains under the maximum allowed connections.

### Join codes

**Join codes are player-shared codes** that **allow players to group together into a logical game session**. Players can share these codes anyway they want, such as through a **Lobby**, **in-game chat**, or an **outside method such as chat service**.

> The join codes are case insensitive, simple, and short. This makes them easy to share, such as in situations where copy and pasting isn't available.

After a host player creates a game session, they then request a join code from the Allocations service to send to their friends. Their friends can then use the join code to join the host player's game session with their game client.

> Allocations and join codes are valid for as long as the host player is connected to the Relay server.

> Allocations and join codes are valid for as long as the host player is connected to the Relay server. If the host player disconnects from the Relay server, or if the connection times out, the allocation and join code become invalid. There is no way to explicitly invalidate a join code.


#### Generate a join code
You can **generate a join code** as the host player either with the **Relay SDK** or directly via the **Relay REST API**.


#### Use a join code to join a game
You can use a join code to **join a Relay server** as a joining player with the **Relay SDK** or the **Relay API**.


### Connection data
Connection data is **a collection of opaque data that uniquely represents a player's connection to a Relay server**. The primary purpose of connection data is to establish a communication channel between the host player and the joining players.

A joining player receives the host player connection data from the Allocations service after requesting to join a session. After the player is bound to a Relay server, they can use the connection data to request permission to open a message channel with the host player. If the Allocations service accepts the request, the joining player can send messages through the Relay server to the host player.

> To send messages through the Relay server, the message must have the **allocation ID** of the recipient. Players aren't aware of the **allocation ID** until they successfully request a connection to the Relay server and the host player.
