## Unity Lobby Service
The **Lobby service** provides a way for players to **discover and connect to each other** to accomplish a variety of multiplayer gaming scenarios.

Lobby **allows your players to connect before or during a game session**. Players create public lobbies using simple game attributes which other players can then search, discover, and join. **Invite-only** lobbies also allow players to create private spaces for select participants only.

Lobby service can do:

- Browse a list of available game sessions and allow the player to select and join one.
- Share a join code with your friend to allow them to directly connect to your game session.
- Use Quick Join to find any available match and jump in.
- Create a private lobby and send invites to your in-game friends list.
- Host a lobby from a game server and use it to manage and restrict access to the server session.
- Query for lobbies that match a specific set of requirements (e.g. game mode, map type).


### Install Lobby SDK
Unity Package named **`com.unity.services.lobby`**.


1.  In Unity, navigate to **Window** > **Package Manager**.
2.  From the **Package Manager**, search for **`com.unity.services.lobby`** or scroll through the **Unity Registry** to find the **Lobby** package.
3.  Select the package and click **Install**.

   
### Authentication
To use the Lobby service, authenticate yourself using [Unity Authentication](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/en/manual/intro-unity-authentication). Make sure to [initialize the authentication service](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/en/manual/initialize-sdk) and sign in before making any calls using the Lobby SDK. While there are many sign in methods, the easiest way to get started is with Anonymous sign in. See the [Unity Authentication anonymous sign in guide](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/en/manual/use-anon-signin) to get started.


### Create a lobby

When a player creates a new lobby, they can set the following properties with the create call:

-   Lobby name (**required**)
-   Lobby visibility (**public or private**)
-   Lobby size (the maximum occupancy)
    -   This is referred to as **Max Players** in the code.
-   Password
    -   An **8 to 64 character password** required to join a lobby.
-   Initial custom lobby data
    -   This can include any **arbitrary data**. For example, map IDs and game modes.
    -   Lobby data with string or numeric values can be indexed, allowing for filtering and ordering on those indexes in queries.
-   Initial (host) player data
    -   For example, player display names, skills and characters.

> **Note**: When a player creates a lobby, they automatically become the host.


#### Public lobby

Public lobbies do not require a lobby code to join and are **displayed in query results** for anyone to join.

The following code sample shows how to create a public lobby:

```cs

string lobbyName = "new lobby";
int maxPlayers = 4;
CreateLobbyOptions options = new CreateLobbyOptions();
//Set IsPrivate to false for public lobby
options.IsPrivate = false;  //set IsPrivate to false for public lobby

Lobby lobby = await LobbyService.Instance.CreateLobbyAsync(lobbyName, maxPlayers, options);

```

#### Private lobby
Private lobbies are **never visible in query results** and **require the lobby code or I**D to be manually provided to new players.

```cs
string lobbyName = "new lobby";
int maxPlayers = 4;
CreateLobbyOptions options = new CreateLobbyOptions();
//Set IsPrivate to true for private lobby
options.IsPrivate = true;

Lobby lobby = await LobbyService.Instance.CreateLobbyAsync(lobbyName, maxPlayers, options);
```

#### Create a lobby with standard, non-indexed data

Lobby data can be included in the create request as well as in subsequent update requests.

The following code sample shows how to create a lobby with standard, non-indexed data:

```cs
string lobbyName = "new lobby";
int maxPlayers = 4;
CreateLobbyOptions options = new CreateLobbyOptions();
options.Data = new Dictionary<string, DataObject>()
{
    {
        "ExamplePublicLobbyData", new DataObject(
            visibility: DataObject.VisibilityOptions.Public, // Visible publicly.
            value: "ExamplePublicLobbyData")
    },
};

Lobby lobby = await LobbyService.Instance.CreateLobbyAsync(lobbyName, maxPlayers, options);
```


#### Create a lobby with indexed string data
The following code sample shows how to create a lobby with indexed string data:

```cs
string lobbyName = "new lobby";
int maxPlayers = 4;
CreateLobbyOptions options = new CreateLobbyOptions();
options.Data = new Dictionary<string, DataObject>()
{
    {
        "GameMode", new DataObject(
            visibility: DataObject.VisibilityOptions.Public, // Visible publicly.
            value: "Conquest",
            index: DataObject.IndexOptions.S1)
    },
};

Lobby lobby = await LobbyService.Instance.CreateLobbyAsync(lobbyName, maxPlayers, options);

```
#### Create a lobby with indexed numeric data

The following code sample shows how to create a lobby with indexed numeric data:

```cs
string lobbyName = "new lobby";
int maxPlayers = 4;
CreateLobbyOptions options = new CreateLobbyOptions();
options.Data = new Dictionary<string, DataObject>()
{
    {
        "MinimumSkillLevel", new DataObject(
            visibility: DataObject.VisibilityOptions.Public, // Visible publicly.
            value: "25",
            index: DataObject.IndexOptions.N1)
    },
};

Lobby lobby = await LobbyService.Instance.CreateLobbyAsync(lobbyName, maxPlayers, options);
```

#### Create a lobby with player data for the host
As with lobby data, player data for the host can also be included in the create request instead of adding it with a separate update request.

The following code sample shows how to create a lobby with player data for the host:

```cs
string lobbyName = "new lobby";
int maxPlayers = 4;
CreateLobbyOptions options = new CreateLobbyOptions();
// Ensure you sign-in before calling Authentication Instance.
// See IAuthenticationService interface.
options.Player = new Player(
    id: AuthenticationService.Instance.PlayerId,
    data: new Dictionary<string, PlayerDataObject>()
    {
        {
            "ExampleMemberPlayerData", new PlayerDataObject(
                visibility: PlayerDataObject.VisibilityOptions.Member, // Visible only to members of the lobby.
                value: "ExampleMemberPlayerData")
        }
    });

Lobby lobby = await LobbyService.Instance.CreateLobbyAsync(lobbyName, maxPlayers, options);

```



### Game Lobby Sample
This sample demonstrates how to use the Lobby and Relay packages to create a typical game lobby experience.


-   **Anonymous Auth login**: Track player credentials without a persistent account.
-   **Lobby creation**: Players host lobbies for others to join.
-   **Lobby query**: Find a list of lobbies with filters, or use lobby codes.
-   **Relay obfuscation**: Players in a lobby are connected through an anonymous IP.
-   **UTP communication**: Players transmit basic data to lobby members in real time.
-   **Lobby + Relay connection management**: Together, the services automatically handle new connections and disconnections.
-   **Vivox Voice**: Create a voice channel for the lobby to allow for voice communication, with per-user volume control and muting.

### Active and inactive lobbies

Lobbies are marked as **inactive** if they havenâ€™t been updated or sent a heartbeat request in the past 30 seconds. You can configure this timeout period. Inactive public lobbies do not appear in query results, and both public and private inactive lobbies are automatically deleted. **Inactive lobbies** can be reactivated by being updated or sending a heartbeat request.
