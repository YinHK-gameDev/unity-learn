## Unity Lobby Service
The **Lobby service** provides a way for players to **discover and connect to each other** to accomplish a variety of multiplayer gaming scenarios.

Lobby **allows your players to connect before or during a game session**. Players create public lobbies using simple game attributes which other players can then search, discover, and join. **Invite-only** lobbies also allow players to create private spaces for select participants only.

Lobby service can do:

- Browse a list of available game sessions and allow the player to select and join one.
- Share a join code with your friend to allow them to directly connect to your game session.
- Use Quick Join to find any available match and jump in.
- Create a private lobby and send invites to your in-game friends list.
- Host a lobby from a game server and use it to manage and restrict access to the server session.
- Query for lobbies that match a specific set of requirements (e.g. game mode, map type).
