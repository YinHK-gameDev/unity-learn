## Unity Lobby Service
The **Lobby service** provides a way for players to **discover and connect to each other** to accomplish a variety of multiplayer gaming scenarios.

Lobby allows your players to connect before or during a game session. Players create public lobbies using simple game attributes which other players can then search, discover, and join. Invite-only lobbies also allow players to create private spaces for select participants only.
