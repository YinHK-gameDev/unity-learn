## Join a lobby
Players can join a lobby by specifying a **lobby ID** or by providing a **lobby code**. Lobby codes are short, auto-generated codes that map to specific lobbies and are intended for players to share with each other. The lobby code for a lobby is available as a members-only lobby property.
