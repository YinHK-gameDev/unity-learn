## Netcode
**Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode)** is a **high-level networking library** built for Unity for you to **abstract networking logic**. It enables you to **send GameObjects and world data across a networking session to many players at once**. With Netcode, you can focus on building your game instead of **low-level protocols and networking frameworks.**


The **Netcode for Entities**, part of the Unity's **Data Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)**, provides a **server authoritive with client prediction framewor**k that you can use to create multiplayer games.

#### Local multiplayer setup
First, build an executable by selecting **File > Build Settings > Build**.

After you have the build, you can **launch several instances of the build executable to host or join a game**.

#### Multiplayer over Internet
First, build an executable and distribute it to all players.
Next, you need to set up Uunity **relay**. 

Alternatively you can use Port Forwarding. The [https://portforward.com/](https://portforward.com/) site has guides on how to enable port forwarding on a huge number of routers.

### Network Synchronizing
https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/advanced-topics/ways-synchronize/

#### Remote Procedure Calls
At a high level, when calling an **`RPC`** client side, the SDK will take a note of the object, component, method and any parameters for that **`RPC`** and send that information over the network. The server will receive that information, find the specified object, find the specified method and call it on the specified object with the received parameters.

When calling an **`RPC`**, you call a method remotely on an object that can be anywhere in the world. They're **"events"** you can trigger when needed.

If you call an **`RPC`** method on your side, it will execute on a different machine.

Netcode has two variations of RPCs to execute logic on either server-side or client-side: [`ServerRpc`](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/advanced-topics/message-system/serverrpc/) and [`ClientRpc`](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/advanced-topics/message-system/clientrpc/).

#### RPC Params

https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/advanced-topics/message-system/rpc-params/

#### RPC usage checklist:
To use RPCs, make sure
â€‹
-   **`[ClientRpc]`** or **`[ServerRpc]`** attributes are on your method
-   Your method name ends with **`ClientRpc`** or **`ServerRpc`** (ex: **`DoSomethingServerRpc()`**)
    > You must mark client RPC methods with the **[ClientRpc]** attribute and use the **ClientRpc** method suffix; failing to do so results in an error message.
    > 
-   your method is declared in a class that inherits from **`NetworkBehaviour`**
    -   your GameObject has a **NetworkObject component** attached
-   Make sure to call your RPC method server side or client side (using **`isClient`** or **`isServer`**)
-   **Only accept value types as parameters**

#### Serialization Types and RPCs

[](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/advanced-topics/messaging-system//#serialization-types-and-rpcs "Direct link to Serialization Types and RPCs")

Instances of Serializable Types are passed into an RPC as parameters and are serialized and replicated to the remote side.

See [Serialization](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/advanced-topics/serialization/serialization-intro/) for more information.

### Connection Approval
To ensures the NetworkConfig on the client matches the server's NetworkConfig. You can enable ConnectionApproval in the NetworkManager or via code by setting `NetworkManager.NetworkConfig.ConnectionApproval` to `true`.

**Server side connection approval example**
```cs

using Unity.Netcode;

private void Setup() 
{
    NetworkManager.Singleton.ConnectionApprovalCallback = ApprovalCheck;
    NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost();
}

private void ApprovalCheck(NetworkManager.ConnectionApprovalRequest request, NetworkManager.ConnectionApprovalResponse response)
{
    // The client identifier to be authenticated
    var clientId = request.ClientNetworkId;

    // Additional connection data defined by user code
    var connectionData = request.Payload;

    // Your approval logic determines the following values
    response.Approved = true;
    response.CreatePlayerObject = true;

    // The Prefab hash value of the NetworkPrefab, if null the default NetworkManager player Prefab is used
    response.PlayerPrefabHash = null;

    // Position to spawn the player object (if null it uses default of Vector3.zero)
    response.Position = Vector3.zero;

    // Rotation to spawn the player object (if null it uses the default of Quaternion.identity)
    response.Rotation = Quaternion.identity;
    
    // If response.Approved is false, you can provide a message that explains the reason why via ConnectionApprovalResponse.Reason
    // On the client-side, NetworkManager.DisconnectReason will be populated with this message via DisconnectReasonMessage
    response.Reason = "Some reason for not approving the client";

    // If additional approval steps are needed, set this to true until the additional steps are complete
    // once it transitions from true to false the connection approval response will be processed.
    response.Pending = false;
}
```

#### Changing the player Prefab
There might be times when you want to specify an alternate player Prefab to use for a player connecting. For example, allow client to choose a player or game character before starting game.
