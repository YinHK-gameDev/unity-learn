### Serialization
Multiplayer framework has built-in serialization support for C# and Unity primitive types out-of-the-box, also with ability to further extend network serialization for user defined types implementing INetworkSerializable interface.

Serialization is the process of converting a data object—a combination of code and data represented within a region of data storage—into a series of bytes that saves the state of the object in an easily transmittable form. In this serialized form, the data can be delivered to another data store (such as an in-memory computing platform), application, or some other destination.
