## Scene Management

### Integrated Scene Management
The Netcode for GameObjects scene management solution is enabled by default and provides you with a fully functional netcode scene management solution.


### Custom Scene Management
If your project has needs that go beyond the scope of the Netcode integrated scene management solution, you can disable scene management in the editor through NetworkManager's properties.
