## Networking components

### NetworkObject
Netcode for GameObjects' high level components, the RPC system, object spawning, and NetworkVariables all rely on there being at least two Netcode components added to a GameObject:

- **NetworkObject**
- **NetworkBehaviour**
>
> > Note: To replicate any Netcode aware properties or send/receive RPCs, a GameObject must have a **NetworkObject component** and at least one **NetworkBehaviour component**.
