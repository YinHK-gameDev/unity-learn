## Unity Transport
The Unity Transport package (com.unity.transport) is a low-level networking library for multiplayer game development.

Itâ€™s the underlying protocol of both Netcode for GameObjects and Netcode for Entities, but you can also use it with a custom solution.

Unity Transport seamlessly supports all platforms the Unity Engine supports thanks to a connection-based abstraction layer (built-in network driver) provided over UDP and WebSockets.
