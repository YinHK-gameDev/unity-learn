## Mirror Networking
The free open source game networking library for Unity 2019 / 2020 / 2021 / 2022.


-   Professional studio project, at least 5 man team, 2 year+ release cycle? NetCode.
    
-   Hobby project with no dedicated network programmer? Mirror. Also, don't make a multiplayer game unless your team is already well-experienced in single player games (or at the very least you have someone with a LOT of network code experience). Real-time multiplayer is complex and time consuming.
