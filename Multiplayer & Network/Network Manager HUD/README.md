## Network Manager HUD

The **Network Manager HUD ("heads-up display")** provides the basic functions so that people playing your game can start hosting a networked game, or find and join an existing networked game. Unity displays the **Network Manager HUD** as a **collection of simple UI**
 buttons in the Game view.
