## Network Manager HUD

The **Network Manager HUD ("heads-up display")** provides the basic functions so that people playing your game can start hosting a networked game, or find and join an existing networked game. Unity displays the **Network Manager HUD** as a **collection of simple UI** buttons in the Game view.

The Network Manager HUD is a quick-start tool to help you start building your multiplayer game straight away, without first having to build a user interface for game creation/connection/joining. The idea is that these controls are useful to get you started, but you should create your own UI later on, to allow your players to find and join games in a way that suits your game.

To start using the Network Manager HUD, create an empty GameObject in your Scene (menu: **GameObject > Create Empty**) and add the **Network Manager HUD component** to the new GameObject.


The **Network Manager HUD** has two basic modes: **LAN (Local Area Network) mode** and **Matchmaker mode**.
