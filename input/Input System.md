## Input System
The Input System package allows your users to control your game or app using a device, touch, or gestures.


> Unity supports input through **two separate systems**, **one older**, and **one newer**.

> The older system, which is built-in to the editor, is called the **Input Manager**. The Input Manager is part of the core Unity platform and is the **default**, if you do not install this Input System Package.

> This **Input System package** is a newer, **more flexible system**, which allows you to use **any kind of Input Device** to control your Unity content. It's intended to be a replacement for Unity's classic Input Manager. It iss referred to as **"The Input System Package"**, or just **"The Input System"**. 

To use **Input System package**, you **must install it into your project** using the **Package Manager**.
