## Input

### Input Manager
The Input Manager window allows you to define input axes and their associated actions for your Project. To access it, from Unity’s main menu, go to **Edit > Project Settings**, then select Input Manager from the navigation on the right.

The Input Manager uses the following types of controls:

- **Key** refers to any key on a physical keyboard, such as W, Shift, or the space bar.
- **Button** refers to any button on a physical controller (for example, gamepads), such as the X button on a remote control.
- A **virtual axis** (plural: **axes**) is mapped to a control, such as a button or a key. When the user activates the control, the axis receives a value in the range of **`[–1..1]`**. You can **use this value in your scripts**.
