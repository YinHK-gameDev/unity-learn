## Using an Actions Asset and PlayerInput Component

The highest level of abstraction provided by the Input System is when you use the **Actions Asset** and 
the **Player Input component** together.

The **Player Input component** takes a **reference to an Actions Asset**, and 
**provides a way to make connections between the Actions defined in that asset**, and **C# methods in your own MonoBehaviour scripts**, 
so that your desired C# methods are called when the user performs an input action.
