## UI with Input System


### Default UI Action Map

### On-screen Controls
You can use **on-screen Controls** to **simulate Input Devices with UI widgets** that the user interacts with on the screen. The most prominent example is the use of **stick** and **button widgets** on **touchscreens to emulate a joystick or gamepad**.

> There are currently two Control types implemented out of the box: **buttons** and **sticks**.

> You can implement custom Controls by extending the base **`OnScreenControl`** class (see documentation on **writing custom on screen Controls** to learn more).


> **Note**: **On-screen Controls** don't have a predefined visual representation. It's up to you to set up the visual aspect of a Control (for example, by adding a sprite or UI component to the GameObject). On-screen Controls take care of the interaction logic and of setting up and generating input from interactions.
