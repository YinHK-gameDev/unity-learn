## Touch

Touch support is divided into:

- low-level support implemented in the **`Touchscreen`** class.
- high-level support implemented in the **`EnhancedTouch.Touch`** class.

> Touch input is supported on Android, iOS, Windows, and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).

| Control | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `primaryTouch` | `TouchControl` | A touch Control that represents the primary touch of the screen. The primary touch drives theÂ `Pointer` representation on the Device. |
| `touches` | `ReadOnlyArray<TouchControl>` | An array of touch Controls that represents all the touches on the Device. |


### Touch Simulation

Touch input can be simulated from **input** on other kinds of **Pointer devices** 
such as **Mouse** and **Pen devices**. \
To enable this, you can either add the 
**`TouchSimulation MonoBehaviour`** to a **`GameObject`** in your scene or 
simply call **`TouchSimulation.Enable`** somewhere in your **startup code**.


```cs
void OnEnable()
    {
        TouchSimulation.Enable();
    }
```

In the editor, you can also **enable touch simulation** by toggling **"Simulate Touch Input From Mouse or Pen"** on in the 
**"Options"** dropdown of the Input Debugger.

**TouchSimulation** will add a **Touchscreen device** and automatically mirror input on any **Pointer device** to the virtual 
touchscreen device.
