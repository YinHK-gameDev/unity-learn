## Input Action Assets

To create an Asset that contains Input Actions in Unity, right-click in the Project window or go to **Assets > Create > Input Actions** from Unity's main menu.

By default, Unity doesn't save edits you make in the Action Asset window when you save the Project. To save your changes, select **Save Asset** in the window's toolbar. To discard your changes, close the window and choose **Don't Save** when prompted. Alternatively, you can toggle auto-saving on by enabling the **Auto-Save** checkbox in the toolbar. This saves any changes to that Asset.

The Action editor window is divided into three panes:

1.  The left pane lists the Action Maps in the Asset. Each Action Map is a collection of Actions that you can enable or disable in bulk.
2.  The middle pane contains the Actions in the currently selected Action Map, and the bindings associated with each Action.
3.  The right pane contains the properties of the currently selected Action or Binding.
