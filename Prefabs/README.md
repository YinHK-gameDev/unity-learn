## Prefabs

### What are prefabs in Unity?

**Prefabs** are a special type of component that allows fully configured GameObjects to be saved in the Project for **reuse**.
These assets can then be shared between scenes, or even other projects without having to be configured again. This is quite useful for objects that will be used many times, such as platforms.

**Prefabs is that they are essentially linked copies of the asset** that exist in the Project window. 

### How to create Prefabs?
Prefabs are created automatically when an object is **dragged from the Hierarchy into the Project window**.
Prefabs look quite similar to other objects that appear in the Project window. However, when selected, their file type will be a **`*.prefab`**. When the Prefab is selected, the Inspector displays all of the components that were configured on the original object.

### How to use Prefabs?
Just drag Prefabs from project window into Hierarchy if you want to reuse. When prefabs are present in the Hierarchy, theyâ€™re represented with blue text and a **blue cube**.
