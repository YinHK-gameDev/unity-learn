## Prefabs

### What are prefabs in Unity?

**Prefabs** are a special type of component that allows fully configured GameObjects to be saved in the Project for **reuse**.
These assets can then be shared between scenes, or even other projects without having to be configured again. This is quite useful for objects that will be used many times, such as platforms.

### How to create Prefabs?
Prefabs are created automatically when an object is **dragged from the Hierarchy into the Project window**.


### How to use Prefabs?
Just drag Prefabs from project window into Hierarchy if you want to reuse. When prefabs are present in the Hierarchy, theyâ€™re represented with blue text and a **blue cube**.
