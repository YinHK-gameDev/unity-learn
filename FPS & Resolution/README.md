## Frame Rate(FPS) & Resolution for Gaming 

- **Frame Rate or FPS** dictates **how smooth a game runs**, improving playability and frame speed. 
- **Resolution** determines the number of pixels on screen, making a game more visually appealing.


> A higher FPS is better for competitive multiplayer games as they require faster reactions, players who want their game to look as beautiful as possible may prioritize a higher resolution and works better for solo games.
