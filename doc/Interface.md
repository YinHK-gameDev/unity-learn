## Unityâ€™s interface


- (A) The Toolbar provides access to your Unity Account and Unity Cloud Services. It also contains controls for Play mode; Undo history; Unity Search; a layer visibility menu; and the Editor layout menu.
- (B) The Hierarchy window is a hierarchical text representation of every GameObject
 in the Scene. Each item in the Scene has an entry in the hierarchy, so the two windows are inherently linked. The hierarchy reveals the structure of how GameObjects attach to each other.
- (C) The Game view simulates what your final rendered game will look like through your Scene Cameras
. When you click the Play button, the simulation begins.
- (D) The Scene view allows you to visually navigate and edit your Scene. The Scene view
 can display a 3D or 2D perspective, depending on the type of Project you are working on.
- (E) Overlays contain the basic tools for manipulating the Scene view and the GameObjects within it. You can also add custom Overlays to improve your workflow.
- (F) The Inspector window allows you to view and edit all the properties of the currently selected GameObject. Because different types of GameObjects have different sets of properties, the layout and contents of the Inspector
 window change each time you select a different GameObject.
- (G) The Project window displays your library of Assets that are available to use in your Project. When you import Assets into your Project, they appear here.
- (H) The status bar provides notifications about various Unity processes, and quick access to related tools and settings.
