## Position gameobject

### For position
Use the dropdown menu to switch between Pivot and Center.

**Pivot positions** the Gizmo at the actual pivot point of the GameObject, as defined by the Transform component.
**Center positions** the Gizmo at a center position based on the selected GameObjects.

### For rotation
Use the dropdown menu to switch between Local and Global.

- **Local** keeps the Gizmo’s rotation relative to the GameObject’s.
- **Global** clamps the Gizmo to world space orientation.
