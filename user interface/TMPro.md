### TextMeshPro

TextMeshPro is the ultimate text solution for Unity. It’s the perfect replacement for Unity’s UI Text and the legacy Text Mesh.

TextMesh Pro is a set of Unity tools for 2D and 3D text.

TextMesh Pro provides better control over text formatting and layout than to Unity's UI Text & Text Mesh systems.


The TextMesh Pro package is included in the Unity Editor. You do not need to install it.


You can switch to other versions of TextMesh Pro from the Packages Window.

To use TextMesh Pro, you must import the TMP Essential Resources package


You can also import the TMP Examples & Extras package to help you learn TextMesh Pro.

### Importing required resources into projects

To use TextMesh Pro in your projects, you need to import the **TMP Essential Resources**.

-   From the menu, select **Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essential Resources**

This adds the essential resources to the **TextMesh Pro** folder in the Project.

### Importing examples and additional resources

TextMesh Pro also includes additional resources and examples to help you learn about various features.

You can import these into your projects as well.

-   From the menu, select **Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Examples & Extras**

This adds the examples and additional resources to the **TextMesh Pro > Examples & Extras** folder in the Project.

Installing the TMP Examples & Extras is not mandatory, but is strongly recommended for first-time TextMesh Pro users.
