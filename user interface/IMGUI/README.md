## IMGUI

**Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface (IMGUI)** is a **code-driven UI Toolkit** that uses the OnGUI function, and scripts that implement it, to draw and manage user interfaces. 

You can use IMGUI to create custom Inspectors for script components, extensions for the Unity Editor, and in-game debugging displays. It is not recommended for building runtime UI.
