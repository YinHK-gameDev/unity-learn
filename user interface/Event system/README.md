## Event system
The Event System is a way of sending events to objects in the application based on input, be it keyboard, mouse, touch, or custom input. The Event System consists of a few components that work together to send events.

When you add an Event System component to a GameObject you will notice that it does not have much functionality exposed, this is because the Event System itself is designed as a manager and facilitator of communication between Event System modules.

The primary roles of the Event System are as follows:

-   Manage which GameObject is considered selected
-   Manage which Input Module is in use
-   Manage Raycasting (if required)
-   Updating all Input Modules as required
