## Encapsulate UXML documents with logic

A Prefab is a pre-made GameObject
 that you can instantiate multiple times in a scene
. Prefabs are useful for creating reusable components. Visual elements
 in UI Toolkit aren’t GameObjects and therefore Prefabs don’t apply. 
 However, you can create a custom control as a reusable UI component that encapsulates a specific hierarchy of elements with logic. 
 Because UI Toolkit encourages you to separate the UI from your game or application code, you can use UXML to define the structure, use USS to define the look, and use C# to define the logic of your custom control.
