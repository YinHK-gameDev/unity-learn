## Event reference

UI Toolkit raises an event when a user interacts with and changes the state of elements from UI
 Toolkit. The event design is similar to the Event interface for HTML elements.

Event types fit into a hierarchy based on the EventBase class. Each event family implements an interface that defines the common characteristics for all events of the same family. For example, BlurEvent and FocusEvent use the FocusEventBase class.
