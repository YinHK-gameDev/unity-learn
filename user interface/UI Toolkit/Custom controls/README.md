## Custom controls
You can create custom controls and implement custom logic for user interface elements. A good custom control is abstract, self-contained, and recurring.

After you have created a custom control, you can style it with USS, add logic to handle events in C#, and expose and use it in UI Builder.


### Create a custom control
To create a custom control, you must create a custom control C# class and initialize it. You can expose it for use in UXML and UI Builder. You can also bind it to data.

Create a C# class derived from the `VisualElement` class or a **subclass** of the `VisualElement` class.
