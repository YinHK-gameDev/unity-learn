## UI builder 

**UI Builder** lets you visually create and edit **UI assets**, such as **UI Documents** (`.uxml`), and **StyleSheets** (`.uss`), that you use with **UI Toolkit**.

You can also install the following optional packages that offer additional functionality in UI Builder:

- The `com.unity.vectorgraphics` package allows you to assign a **VectorImage** as a background style on an element.
- The `com.unity.2d.sprite` package allows you to assign a 2D **Sprite** asset (or sub-asset) as a background style on an element. With the 2D Sprite package installed, you can also open the 2D Sprite Editor directly from the **Inspector** pane.

To open the **UI Builder** window:

Select **Window > UI Toolkit > UI Builder**. This opens a **UXML** document that has been previously loaded with **UIBuilder**. From the Project window, double-click a **UXML** file.
