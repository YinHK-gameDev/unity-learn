## USS 

Selectors decide which elements that USS rules affect.

USS supports a set of simple selectors that are analogous, but not identical, to simple selectors in CSS. A simple selector matches elements by element type, USS class, element name, and wildcard.

You can combine simple selectors into complex selectors, or append pseudo-classes to them to target elements in specific states. USS supports descendant, child, and multiple complex selectors.

| Child selectors | Match elements that are children of another element in the visual tree. |
| Multiple selectors | Select elements that match all the simple selectors. |
| Selectors list | Create a comma-separated list of selectors that share the same style rule. |
