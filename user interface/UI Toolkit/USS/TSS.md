## Theme Style Sheet (TSS)

**Theme Style Sheet (TSS)** files are regular USS files. UI
 Toolkit treats TSS as a distinct asset type and uses it for management purposes.

Regular **USS syntax** and format apply to **TSS** files, but usually, a theme file contains references to other USS files through the `@import rule`.

Note: USS files also support the `@import rule`.
