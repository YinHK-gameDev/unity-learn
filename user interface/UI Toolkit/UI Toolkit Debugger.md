## UI Toolkit Debugger
The UI
 Toolkit Debugger is a tool that you can use to inspect and debug your UI elements in real-time. It provides a visual representation of your UI hierarchy. You use it to examine the state and properties of each UI element.
 
To use the UI Toolkit Debugger:
1. Select **Window > UI Toolkit > Debugger** to open the **UI Toolkit Debugger** window.
2. Do the following:
   - To debug elements in UI Builder, in the Viewport window of the UI Builder, click Preview to enable the Preview mode. Preview mode turns off the invisible elements in the Canvas. Those invisible elements absorb all mouse events and are used to pick elements for editing. UI Toolkit Debugger will pick them instead of your actual elements if theyâ€™re not turned off.
   - To debug elements in the scene view, select the GameObject and enter Play mode.
3. In the UI Toolkit Debugger window, select Pick Element.
4. In the Canvas of the UI Builder or in the Game view, select the element that you want to debug. The UI Toolkit Debugger window shows a live view of your UI hierarchy and displays the following:
   - All child elements of the VisualElement
   - All USS selectors for each component of the VisualElement
   - Detailed information for each USS selector
