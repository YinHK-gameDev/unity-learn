## Runtime UI

You can create a **runtime UI** and display it in a game view by the following steps:

- Create a UI Document (**`.uxml`**) with controls.
- Add a UIDocument GameObject in the scene and add the UXML file as the source asset for it.
- Create **`MonoBehaviours`** to define the behavior of your UI controls.
