## Create a Custom Inspector

Reason to write a custom inspector:

- Create a more user-friendly representation of script properties.
- Organize and group properties together.
- Display or hide sections of the UI depending on the userâ€™s choices.
- Provide additional information about the meaning of individual settings and properties.

Creating custom inspectors using UI Toolkit is similar to using Immediate Mode GUI (IMGUI), but UI Toolkit has several advantages, such as automatic data binding and automatic undo support. Where IMGUI creates the UI for the inspector entirely through script, UI Toolkit allows you to build the UI via script, visually in UI Builder, or a combination of both.
