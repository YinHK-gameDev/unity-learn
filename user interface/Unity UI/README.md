## Unity UI

Unity UI is a UI toolkit for developing user interfaces for games and applications. The Unity User Interface (Unity UI) package (also called uGUI) is an older, GameObject-based UI system that you can use to develop runtime UI for games and applications. It is a GameObject-based UI system that uses Components and the Game View to arrange, position, and style user interfaces. You cannot use Unity UI to create or change user interfaces in the Unity Editor.
