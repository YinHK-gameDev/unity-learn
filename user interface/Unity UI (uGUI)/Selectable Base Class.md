## Selectable Base Class

![](./img/UI_SelectableNavigationExplicit.png)

The Selectable Class is the **base class** for all the **interaction components** and it handles the items that are in common.

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
| --- | --- |
| **Interactable** | This determines if this component will accept input. When it is set to false interaction is disabled and the transition state will be set to the disabled state. |
| **Transition** | Within a selectable component there are several depending on what state the selectable is currently in. The different states are: normal, highlighted, pressed and disabled. |
| **Navigation** | There are also a number of Navigation Options to control **how keyboard navigation of the controls is implemented**. |


### Transition Options:

Within a selectable component there are several transition options depending on what state the selectable is currently in. The different states are: **normal**, **highlighted**, **pressed** and **disabled**.

| **Transition Options:** | **Function:** |
| --- | --- |
| **None** | This option is for the button to have no state effects at all. |
| **Color Tint** | Changes the colour of the button depending on what state it is in. It is possible to select the colour for each individual state. It is also possible to set the Fade Duration between the different states. The higher the number is, the slower the fade between colors will be. |
| **Sprite Swap** | Allows different sprites to display depending on what state the button is currently in, the sprites can be customised. |
| **Animation** | Allows animations to occur depending on the state of the button, an animator component must exist in order to use animation transition. Itâ€™s important to make sure root motion is disabled. To create an animation controller click on generate animation (or create your own) and make sure that an animation controller has been added to the animator component of the button. |

> Each Transition option (except None) provides additional options for controlling the transitions. We'll go into details with those in each of the sections below.


#### Color Tint

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
| --- | --- |
| **Target Graphic** | The graphic used for the interaction component. |
| **Normal Color** | The normal color of the control |
| **Highlighted Color** | The color of the control when it is highlighted |
| **Pressed Color** | The color of the control when it is pressed |
| **Disabled Color** | The color of the control when it is disabled |
| **Color Multiplier** | This multiplies the tint color for each transition by its value. With this you can create colors greater than 1 to brighten the colors (or alpha channel) on graphic elements whose base color is less than white (or less then full alpha). |
| **Fade Duration** | The time taken, in seconds, to fade from one state to another |

#### Sprite Swap

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
| --- | --- |
| **Target Graphic** | The normal sprite to use |
| **Highlighted Sprite** | Sprite to use when the control is highlighted |
| **Pressed Sprite** | Sprite to use when the control is pressed |
| **Disabled Sprite** | Sprite to use when the control is disabled |

#### Animation

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
| --- | --- |
| **Normal Trigger** | The normal animation trigger to use |
| **Highlighted Trigger** | Trigger to use when the control is highlighted |
| **Pressed Trigger** | Trigger to use when the control is pressed |
| **Disabled Trigger** | Trigger to use when the control is disabled |

### Navigation Options

**Navigation Options** to control how **keyboard navigation** of the controls is implemented.

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
| --- | --- |
| **Navigation** | The Navigation options refers to how the navigation of UI elements in play mode will be controlled. |
| **None** | No keyboard navigation. Also ensures that it does not receive focus from clicking/tapping on it. |
| **Horizontal** | Navigates Horizontally. |
| **Vertical** | Navigates Vertically. |
| **Automatic** | Automatic Navigation. |
| **Explicit** | In this mode you can explicitly specify where the control navigates to for different arrow keys. |
| **Visualize** | Selecting Visualize gives you a visual representation of the navigation you have set up in the scene window. See below. |

In the above visualization mode, the arrows indicate how the change of focus is set up for the collection of controls as a group. That means - for each individual UI control - you can see which UI control will get focus next, if the user **presses an arrow key** when the given control has focus. So in the example shown above, If the "button" has focus and the user **presses the right arrow key**, the **first (left-hand) vertical slider will then become focused**. 

Note that the vertical sliders can't be focused-away-from using up or down keys, because they control the value of the slider. The same is true of the horizontal sliders and the left/right arrow keys.



### Selectable class
**object(C#) -> Object(Unity) -> Component -> Behaviour -> MonoBehaviour -> ....**

```cs
public ColorBlock colors { get; set; }

public Image image { get; set; }

//How many selectable elements are currently active.
public static int allSelectableCount { get; }

//A List instance of the allSelectablesArray to maintain API compatibility.
public static List<Selectable> allSelectables { get; }

//Copy of the array of all the selectable objects currently active in the scene.
public static Selectable[] allSelectablesArray { get; }

//Convenience function to get the Animator component on the GameObject.
public Animator animator { get; }

public bool interactable { get; set; }

//The Navigation setting for this selectable object.
public Navigation navigation { get; set; }

//The SpriteState for this selectable object.
public SpriteState spriteState { get; set; }

//The type of transition that will be applied to the targetGraphic when the state changes.
public Selectable.Transition transition { get; set; }

protected bool IsHighlighted();

public virtual bool IsInteractable();

protected bool IsPressed();

protected override void OnValidate();

public virtual void OnSelect(BaseEventData eventData);

public virtual void Select();

protected override void Reset();
