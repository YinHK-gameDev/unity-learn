## Rect transform
The Rect Transform component is the 2D layout counterpart of the Transform component. Where Transform represents a single point, Rect Transform represent a rectangle that a UI element can be placed inside. If the parent of a Rect Transform is also a Rect Transform, the child Rect Transform can also specify how it should be positioned and sized relative to the parent rectangle.
