## Auto Layout
The Rect Transform layout system is flexible enough to handle a lot of different types of layouts and it also allows placing elements in a complete freeform fashion. However, sometimes something a bit more structured can be needed.

The auto layout system provides ways to place elements in nested layout groups such as horizontal groups, vertical groups, or grids. It also allows elements to automatically be sized according to the contained content. For example a button can be dynamically resized to exactly fit its text content plus some padding.

The auto layout system is a system built on top of the basic Rect Transform layout system. It can optionally be used on some or all elements.
