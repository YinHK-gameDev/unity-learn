## Input Field

The Input Field script can be added to any existing Text control object from the menu (**Component > UI > Input Field**). Having done this, you should also drag the object to the Input Field's _Text_ property to enable editing.

The _Text_ property of the Text control itself will change as the user types and the value can be retrieved from a script after editing. Note that Rich Text is intentionally not supported for editable Text controls; the field will apply any Rich Text markup instantly when typed but the markup essentially "disappears" and there is no subsequent way to change or remove the styling.
