## Profiler

The Unity Profiler is a tool you can **use to get performance information about your application**. You can connect it to devices on your network or devices connected to your machine to test how your application runs on your intended release platform. You can also run it in the Editor to get an overview of resource allocation while youâ€™re developing your application.


To access the Profiler window go to menu: **Window > Analysis > Profiler**. 

When you use the Unity Profiler to profile your application, there are three main ways to record data:

-   Profile your application in a player on your target platform
-   Profile your application in Play mode in the Unity Editor
-   Profile the Unity Editor

The Profiler window is laid out as follows: 

- **Profiler modules**. This is a list of all the modules you can profile in your application. Use the drop-down menu at the top of this area to add and remove modules from the window.
- **Profiler control**s. Use these controls to set which device to profile from and what kind of profiling Unity should perform, navigate between frames, and start recording data.
- **Frame charts**. This area contains charts of each module the Profiler profiles. This area is blank when you open the Profiler for the first time, and fills with information when you start profiling your application.
- **Module details panel**. The information in this area of the window changes based on the module you have selected. For instance, when you select the CPU Usage Profiler module, it contains a detailed timeline and the option to switch to a Hierarchy view. When you select the Rendering Profiler module, this area displays a list of debugging information. This area is blank when you open the Profiler for the first time, and fills with information when you start profiling your application.

public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Example()
    {
        Profiler.BeginSample("MyPieceOfCode");
        // Code to measure...
