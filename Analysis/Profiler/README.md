## Profiler

The Unity Profiler is a tool you can **use to get performance information about your application**. You can connect it to devices on your network or devices connected to your machine to test how your application runs on your intended release platform. You can also run it in the Editor to get an overview of resource allocation while youâ€™re developing your application.


To access the Profiler window go to menu: **Window > Analysis > Profiler**. 

When you use the Unity Profiler to profile your application, there are three main ways to record data:

-   Profile your application in a player on your target platform
-   Profile your application in Play mode in the Unity Editor
-   Profile the Unity Editor
