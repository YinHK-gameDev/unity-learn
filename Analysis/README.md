## Unity Analysis

When you make an application in Unity, it’s important that you **analyze and debug** it to make sure that its b**ug-free, optimized, and runs correctly** on the target device.

- Memory in Unity
- The Unity Profiler
- Log files
- Asset Loading Metrics


Unity has several tools that you can use to **measure the performance** of your game:

- **The Unity Profiler**
- **Memory Profiler (package)**
- **Frame Debugger**
- **Physics Debugger**
- **Input Debugger**
- **IMGUI Debugger**


### The Unity Profiler

The Unity Profiler is a tool you can use to get performance information about your application. You can connect it to devices on your network or devices connected to your machine to test how your application runs on your intended release platform. You can also run it in the Editor to get an overview of resource allocation while you’re developing your application.
