## Constraints

A Constraint component links the position, rotation, or scale of a GameObject
 to another GameObject. A constrained GameObject moves, rotates, or scales like the GameObject it is linked to.

Unity supports the following types of Constraint components:

- **Aim**: Rotate the constrained GameObject to face the linked GameObject.
- **Look At**: Rotate the constrained GameObject to the linked GameObject (simplified Aim Constraint).
- **Parent**: Move and rotate the constrained GameObject with the linked GameObject.
- **Position**: Move the constrained GameObject like the linked GameObject.
- **Rotation**: Rotate the constrained GameObject like the linked GameObject.
- **Scale**: Scale the constrained GameObject like the linked GameObject.
