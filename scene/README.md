## Scene

### Creating a new scene
There are several ways to create a new scene:

- Use the New Scene dialog to create a new scene from a specific scene template.
- Use the menu or the Project window to create new scenes from your Projectâ€™s Basic scene template without opening the New Scene dialog.
- Create a scene from a specific template directly from a C# script.
