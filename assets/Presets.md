## Presets
**Presets** to apply **custom default settings for types of assets.**

Presets are assets that you can use to save and apply identical property settings across multiple components, assets, or Project Settings windows. You can also use Presets to specify default settings for new components and default import settings for assets in the Preset Manager The Preset Manager supports any importers, components, or scriptable objects you add to the Unity Editor.

Presets allow you to save the property configuration of a component, asset, or Project Settings window as a Preset asset. You can then use this Preset asset to apply the same settings to a different component, asset, or Project Settings window.
