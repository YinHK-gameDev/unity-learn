## AssetBundles
An **AssetBundle** is an **archive file** that contains platform-specific non-code Assets (such as **Models, Textures, Prefabs, Audio clips, and even entire Scenes**) that Unity can load at run time.


AssetBundles can be useful for **downloadable content (DLC)**, reducing initial install size, loading assets optimized for the end-userâ€™s platform, and reduce runtime memory pressure.
