### Materials
You can use this tab to change how Unity deals with Materials and Textures when importing your model.

When Unity imports a Model without any Material assigned, it uses the Unity diffuse Material. If the Model has Materials, Unity imports them as sub-Assets.


The Materials tab defines how Unity imports Materials and Textures

> Click the **Extract Materials** and **Extract Textures** buttons to extract all Materials and Textures that are embedded in your imported Asset. These are greyed out if there are no sub-Assets to extract. Below these buttons, Unity displays any messages about the import process.
