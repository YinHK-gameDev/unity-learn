## Create Avatar

Since the Avatar is such an important aspect of the animation system, it is important to configure it properly for your Model.

For this reason, whether or not the automatic Avatar creation succeeds, you should always check that your Avatar is valid and properly set up.


When you create an Avatar in the **Rig** tab, you can configure the Avatar.

If the model does not yield a valid match, you can use a similar process to the one that Unity uses internally:
1. Choose Clear from the Mapping menu at the bottom of the Avatar window to reset any mapping that Unity attempted.
2. Choose Sample Bind-pose from the Pose menu at the bottom of the Avatar window to approximate the Modelâ€™s initial modeling pose.
3. Choose **Mapping > Automap** to create a bone-mapping from an initial pose.
4. Choose **Pose > Enforce** T-Pose to set the Model back to to required T-pose.

If automapping fails completely or partially, you can manually assign bones by either dragging them from the Scene
 view or from the Hierarchy view. If Unity thinks a bone fits, it appears in green in the Avatar Mapping tab; otherwise it appears in red.
