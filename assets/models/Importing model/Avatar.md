## Create Avatar

Since the Avatar is such an important aspect of the animation system, it is important to configure it properly for your Model.

For this reason, whether or not the automatic Avatar creation succeeds, you should always check that your Avatar is valid and properly set up.


When you create an Avatar in the **Rig** tab, you can configure the Avatar.
