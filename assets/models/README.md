## Game asset models

### 3D Assets

We can use tools like **Probuilder** to create models in Unity. However, these work best for prototyping, rather than for the final product.

To add more polished 3D assets to your final product, create 3D Models, Materials and Textures in 3D modeling software and then import them into Unity, like blender, zbrush etc.

### Importing 3D Model Files
Unity uses the `.fbx` model format. You can also use other common native model formats (for example, `.max`, `.blend`, `.mb`, `.ma`), and Unity converts them into `.fbx` once they are imported.
