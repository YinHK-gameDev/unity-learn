### Asset processing
Unity reads and processes any files that you add to the Assets folder, and converts the contents of the file to internal game-ready data. The asset files themselves remain unchanged, and the internal data is stored in the project’s **Library folder**. This data is part of the **Unity Editor’s Asset Database**.

Unity stores the internal representation of your assets in the Library folder, which behaves like a cache folder. As a user, you should never need to alter the Library folder manually; if you do, you might negatively affect your project in the Unity Editor. This also means that you should not include the Library folder under version control.

> **Note**: If your project is not open in Unity, you can safely delete the Library folder, because Unity can regenerate all of its data from the Assets and ProjectSettings folders the next time you launch your project.
