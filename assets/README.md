### Asset processing
Unity reads and processes any files that you add to the Assets folder, and converts the contents of the file to internal game-ready data. The asset files themselves remain unchanged, and the internal data is stored in the project’s **Library folder**. This data is part of the **Unity Editor’s Asset Database**.
