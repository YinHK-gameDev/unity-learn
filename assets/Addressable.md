## Addressables
Mainly used in assets.

The **Addressable Asset System** allows the developer to ask for an **asset** **via its address**. Once an asset (e.g. a prefab) is marked **"addressable"**, it **generates an address which can be called from anywhere**. 

Wherever the asset resides (**local or remote**), the system will **locate it and its dependencies**, then **return it**.

Use **Window > Asset Management > Addressables** to begin working with the system.




> **Addressable Assets** are assets that have a **unique address** which you can use to **load them from local or remote AssetBundles**.
