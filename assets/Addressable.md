## Addressables
Mainly used in assets.

The **Addressable Asset System** allows the developer to **ask for** an **asset** **via its address**. Once an asset (e.g. a prefab) is marked **"addressable"**, it **generates an address which can be called from anywhere**. 

Wherever the asset resides (**local or remote**), the system will **locate it and its dependencies**, then **return it**.

Use **Window > Asset Management > Addressables** to begin working with the system.




> **Addressable Assets** are assets that have a **unique address** which you can use to **load them from local or remote AssetBundles**.

### Concepts

-   **Address** - Identifies an Asset for easy run-time retrieval.
-   **AddressableAssetData directory** - Stores your addressable Asset metadata in your Projectâ€™s Assets directory.
-   **Asset Group** - Denotes a set of addressable Assets available for build-time processing.
-   **Asset Group Schema** - Defines a set of data that can be assigned to a group and used during the build.
-   **AssetReference** - An object that operates like a direct reference, but with deferred initialization (for example, for lazy loading). The `AssetReference` stores the GUID as an addressable that you can load on-demand.
-   **Asynchronous Loading** - allows the location of the Asset and dependencies (for example, local, remote and generated) to change throughout the course of your development without changing the game code. Async Loading is foundational to the Addressable Asset System.
-   **Build Script** - runs Asset Group Processors to package Assets and provides the mapping between Addresses and Resource Locations for the Resource Manager.
-   **Label** - provides an additional addressable Asset identifier for run-time loading of similar items. For example: `Addressables.DownloadDependenciesAsync("spaceHazards");`


    
### Install Addressables
To install the Addressables package in your project, use the Package Manager:

1.  Open the Package Manager (menu: **Window > Package Manager**).
2.  Set the package list to display packages from the **Unity Registry**.
3.  Select the **Addressables package** in the list.
4.  Click **Install** (at the bottom, right-hand side of the Package Manager window).

To set up the Addressables system in your Project after installation, open the **Addressables Groups** window and click **Create Addressables Settings**.

### Make an asset Addressable

You can make an asset Addressable in the following ways:

-   Enable the **Addressable** property in the asset's **Inspector** window.
    ![](./img/inspectorcheckbox.png)
-   Assign the asset to an **AssetReference field** in the **Inspector** window.
-   Drag the asset into a group on the **Addressables Groups window**.
-   In the Project window, move the asset into a folder that's marked as **Addressable**.

> Once you make an asset **Addressable**, the **Addressables system** adds it to a **default gr**oup, unless you place it in a specific group. **Addressables packs assets in a group into AssetBundles** according to your group settings when you make a content build. \
> You can **load these assets** using the **`Addressables` API**.

### Building your game

Addressables needs to build your content into files that can be consumed by the running game before you build the player. This step is not done automatically. You can build this content via the UI or API.

1.  UI a. Open the **Addressables** window. b. Select **Build->Build Player Content**
2.  API a. **`AddressableAssetSettings.BuildPlayerContent()`**

### Loading or instantiating by address

You can load or instantiate an Asset at run-time. Loading an Asset loads all dependencies into memory (including Asset bundle data if relevant). This allows you to use the Asset when you need to. Instantiating loads the Asset, and then immediately adds it to the scene.

To access an Asset in script using a string address:

`Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("AssetAddress");`

or

`Addressables.InstantiateAsync("AssetAddress");`

`LoadAssetAsync` and `InstantiateAsync` are asynch operations. You may provide a callback to work with the asset once it is loaded. 

```cs
  GameObject myGameObject;


        ...
        Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("AssetAddress").Completed += OnLoadDone;
    }

    private void OnLoadDone(UnityEngine.ResourceManagement.AsyncOperations.AsyncOperationHandle<GameObject> obj)
    {
        // In a production environment, you should add exception handling to catch scenarios such as a null result;
        myGameObject = obj.Result;
    }

```


### Using the AssetReference Class

The **`AssetReference`** class provides a mechanism to access Assets without the need to know string (or other) addresses.

To access an Addressable Asset using the \*AssetReference \*class:

1.  Select an Asset.
2.  In the Inspector, click the **Add Component** button and then select the component type.
3.  Add a public `AssetReference` object in the component. For example: `public AssetReference explosion;`
4.  In the Inspector, set which Asset the object is linked to by either dragging an Asset from the Project window onto the entry or clicking the entry to choose from previously defined addressable Assets

   
#### Loading an Addressable Asset by object reference

To load an `AssetReference`, call one of the methods defined on it. For example:

`AssetRefMember.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>();`

or

`AssetRefMember.InstantiateAsync(pos, rot);`

`LoadAssetAsync` and `InstantiateAsync` are asynch operations. You may provide a callback to work with the asset once it is loaded.
