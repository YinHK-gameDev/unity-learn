## In Game Console for debug


### Quantum Console

Quantum Console is a powerful and easy to use in-game command console. By simply adding [Command] to your code you can add your own commands and dev cheats to the console!

- Static and non-static commands

- Command overloads and default parameters

- Generic commands

- Async commands

- Interactive commands with coroutine-like actions

- Generate commands at runtime with lambda commands

- Supports functions, properties, fields and delegates

- Per command platform black/whitelist

- Easy to use

- Full C# source included

In order to get started as quickly as possible, simply follow the following steps:

1.  Ensure the Text Mesh Pro package is installed; this is done by default for new projects
2.  Add an Event System to your scene if you do not already have one `GameObject > UI > EventSystem`
3.  Navigate to `Assets/Plugins/QFSW/Quantum Console/Source/Prefabs` and add the `Quantum Console` prefab to your scene.

After this, you are ready to try out Quantum Console!
