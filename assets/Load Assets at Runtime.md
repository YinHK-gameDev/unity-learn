## Load Assets at Runtime
You can use **Resource Folders** in your project to include content in your player build, which will make it available to load when needed, independently of the scenes that you build.

### Resource Folders
Resource Folders contain collections of assets that are included in the built Unity player even when they are not directly referenced from any Scene included the Build.


> **Note**: All assets found in the **Resources** folders and their dependencies are stored in a file in the build output called resources.assets. If a scene in the build references an asset then that asset is serialized into a sharedAssets*.assets file instead.

> Only assets that are in the Resources folder can be accessed through **`Resources.Load()`**. \
> However many more assets might end up in the **resources.assets** file since they are dependencies. \
> For example a Material in the Resources folder might reference a Texture outside of the Resources folder. In that case the Texture is also included in the resources.assets file, \
> but it is not available to load directly.

### Resource Unloading
If you want to destroy scene objects that were loaded using **`Resources.Load()`** prior to loading another scene, call **`Object.Destroy()`** on them. 
To release assets and reclaim memory, use **`Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets()`**.


### Limitations and Alternatives
The Resources system is convenient to use, especially for **rapid prototyping and small projects**. \
But it **does not scale well and overall use** of this feature is discouraged. \
For this reason **`AssetBundles`** and the **`Addressables`** package are the **recommended alternative**.

Some downsides of using Resources:

-   Placing a lot of content in this folder will **slow down application startup** and the **length of builds**.
-   The Resource folder is **not appropriate for delivering custom content** for specific platforms.
-   **Making changes** to Assets in the Resource folder **requires a player rebuild** and **redeployment**, whereas **`AssetBundles`** are better suited for **incremental content updates**.


The resources folder can be appropriate for small Assets that are required throughout the projectâ€™s lifetime, that do not require updates, and do not vary across platforms or devices. Resource assets might be part of the minimal bootstrapping for a game, with the main content downloaded on-demand with AssetBundles. But local AssetBundles located in the **StreamingAssets** folder could also serve that bootstrapping need.
