## Layer Collision Matrix

### Setting up layer-based collision detection
To select a Layer for your GameObjects to belong to, select the GameObject, navigate to the Inspector window, select the Layer dropdown at the top, and either choose a Layer or add a new Layer. Repeat for each GameObject until you have finished assigning your GameObjects to Layers.
