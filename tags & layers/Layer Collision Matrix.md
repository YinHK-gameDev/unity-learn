## Layer Collision Matrix

### Setting up layer-based collision detection
- To select a Layer for your GameObjects to belong to, select the GameObject, navigate to the Inspector window, select the Layer dropdown at the top, and either choose a Layer or add a new Layer. Repeat for each GameObject until you have finished assigning your GameObjects to Layers.
- In the Unity menu bar, go to **Edit > Project Settings**, then select the Physics category to open the Physics window.
- Select which layers on the Collision Matrix will interact with the other layers by checking them.
