## Video Player component

Use the **Video Player component** to **attach video files** to GameObjects, and play them on the GameObject’s **Texture** at run time.

By default, the Material Property of a **Video Player component** is set to a GameObject’s **main texture**, which means that when the Video Player component is attached to a GameObject that has a **Renderer**, it **automatically assigns itself to the Texture on that Renderer** (because this is the main Texture for the GameObject).
