## Video
Use **Unityâ€™s video system** to integrate video into your game. 
Video footage can **add realism**, **save on rendering complexity**, or help you integrate content available externally.

To use video in Unity, import **Video Clips** and configure them using the **Video Player component**. The system allows you to feed video footage directly into the **Texture parameter** of any component that has one. Unity then plays the Video on that **Texture** at run time.
