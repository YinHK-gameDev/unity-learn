## Terrain

The Unity Editor includes a built-in set of Terrain features that allow you to add landscapes to your game. In the Editor, you can create multiple Terrain tiles, adjust the height or appearance of your landscape, and add trees or grass to it
 
To add a Terrain GameObject to your Scene, **select GameObject** > **3D Object** > **Terrain from the menu**. 
 
This also adds a corresponding Terrain Asset to the Project view. When you do this, the landscape is initially a large, flat plane. The Terrain’s Inspector window provides a number of tools to create detailed landscape features.
