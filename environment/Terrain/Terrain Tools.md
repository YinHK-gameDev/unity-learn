## Terrain Tools 5.1.0 package
The Terrain Tools package improves the workflow for creating Terrain ecosystems in Unity. You can download this package through the Package Manager in 2019.1 and newer versions of Unity. 

While Unity includes a built-in set of Terrain features that provide basic tooling, the Terrain Tools package adds more advanced features such as erosion tools, sculpting tools, and Brush Mask Filters. 
It also contains the Terrain Toolbox, which lets you create new Terrain from preset files or imported heightmaps, batch change settings on multiple Terrain tiles, and **import/export splatmaps** and **heightmaps**.
