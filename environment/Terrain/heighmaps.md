## Heightmaps
Terrain tools that affect height, such as **Raise or Lower Terrain** and **Set Height**, use a grayscale texture called a **heightmap**. 

Unity represents the **height of each point on the Terrain as a value in a rectangular array**. It represents this array using a **grayscale heightmap**. 

**Heightmaps** are **built into the Terrain**, and the **values stored in a heightmap** **define the height of each point** or **vertex on the Terrain**.

### Importing and exporting heightmaps

You can **import** and **export** heightmaps into the Unity Editor. 
This is useful when you want to use real world height data to replicate a landmark such as Mount Everest, or work on a heightmap image in an external editor like Photoshop. 

You can also use 3D modelling applications, such as **Houdini** and **World Machine**, to **generate Terrain**, then import your Terrain into Unity as a **heightmap**.
