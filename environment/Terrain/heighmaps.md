## Heightmaps
Terrain tools that affect height, such as **Raise or Lower Terrain** and **Set Height**, use a grayscale texture called a **heightmap**. 

Unity represents the **height of each point on the Terrain as a value in a rectangular array**. It represents this array using a **grayscale heightmap**. 

**Heightmaps** are built into the Terrain, and the values stored in a heightmap **define the height of each point** or **vertex on the Terrain**.
