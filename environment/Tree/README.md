## Tree Editor

Unity provides a tool called Tree Editor that lets you design trees directly within the editor.



### SpeedTree

You can use **SpeedTree Modeler** from IDV, Inc. to create trees with advanced visual effects such as smooth LOD
transition, fast billboarding and natural wind animation,
 
 
### Building a tree

#### Adding a new Tree
To create a new Tree asset, select **GameObject > 3D Object > Tree**. You’ll see a new Tree asset is created in your Project View, and instantiated in the currently open Scene. This new tree is very basic with only a single branch, so let’s add some character to it.

Select the tree to view the **Tree** window in the **Inspector**A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/tree-FirstTree.htmlUsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/tree-FirstTree.htmlGlossary.html#Inspector). This interface provides all the tools for shaping and sculpting your trees. You will see the **Tree Hierarchy** window with two nodes present: the **Tree Root** node and a single **Branch Group** node, which we’ll call the trunk of the tree.

In the **Tree Hierarchy**, select the **Branch Group**, which acts as the trunk of the tree. Click on the **Add Branch Group** button and you’ll see a new **Branch Group** appear connected to the Main Branch. Now you can play with the settings in the **Branch** **Group Properties** to see alterations of the branches attached to the tree trunk.
