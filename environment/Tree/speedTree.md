## SpeedTree
**SpeedTree**, a suite of products by IDV Inc., provides prebuilt tree Assets and modeling software focused specifically on trees.


Unity recognizes and imports SpeedTree Assets in the same way that it handles other Assets. If you’re using SpeedTree Modeler 7, make sure to resave your `.spm` files using the Unity version of the Modeler. If you’re using SpeedTree Modeler 8, save your `.st` files directly into the Unity Project folder.
