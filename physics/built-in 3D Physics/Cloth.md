## Cloth
The Cloth component works with the Skinned Mesh
 Renderer to provide a physics-based solution for simulating fabrics. It is specifically designed for character clothing, and only works with the Skinned Mesh Renderer
. If you add a Cloth component to a GameObject
 with a regular Mesh Renderer, Unity removes the Mesh Renderer and adds a Skinned Mesh Renderer.
