## Cloth physics
The **Cloth component** works with the **Skinned Mesh Renderer** to provide a physics-based solution for **simulating fabrics**. It is specifically designed for character clothing, and only works with the **Skinned Mesh Renderer**. If you add a Cloth component to a GameObject with a regular Mesh Renderer, Unity removes the Mesh Renderer and adds a Skinned Mesh Renderer.
