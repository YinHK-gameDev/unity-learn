## character controller

The character in a first- or third-person game usually needs some collision-based physics so that it doesn’t fall through the floor or walk through walls. In many applications, the character’s acceleration and movement are intentionally not physically realistic, so that the character can accelerate, brake and change direction almost instantly and without being affected by momentum.

A simple, capsule-shaped collider component with specialized features for behaving as a character in a game. Unlike true collider components, a Rigidbody is not needed and the momentum effects are not realistic.
