## Articulations(闗節)
A physics articulation is a **set of Articulation Bodies** organized in a **logical tree**, in which each** parent-child relationship** reflects mutually constrained relative motion.

The main purpose of physics articulations is to **provide a realistic physics behavior** for **industrial** and **commercial non-gaming applications** that involve **joints**. For example, they make it a lot easier than the regular Joints to simulate robotic arms and kinematic chains.

You can configure articulations via the ArticulationBody class, or the corresponding Articulation Body component.


### Articulation Body

Articulation Bodies **enable you to build physics articulations** such as **robotic arms** or **kinematic chains** with GameObjects that are **hierarchically organized**. They help you get realistic physics behaviors in the context of **simulation for industrial applications**.
