## Physics articulations
A physics articulation is a set of Articulation Bodies organized in a logical tree, in which each parent-child relationship reflects mutually constrained relative motion.


#### Articulation Body component
Articulation Bodies enable you to build **physics articulations** such as **robotic arms** or **kinematic chains with GameObjects**
 that are hierarchically organized.
