## Rigid body physics

To simulate physics-based behavior such as movement, gravity, collision, and joints, you need to configure items in your scene as rigid bodies. To configure GameObjects as rigid bodies in Unity’s PhysX system, you can assign them the Rigidbody component. The Rigidbody component is represented in the API by the Rigidbody class.
