## Rigid body physics

To simulate physics-based behavior such as **movement, gravity, collision, and joints**, you need to configure items in your scene as rigid bodies. To configure **GameObject**s as rigid bodies in Unityâ€™s PhysX system, you can assign them the **Rigidbody component**. The **Rigidbody component** is represented in the API by the **Rigidbody class**.
