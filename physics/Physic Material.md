## Physic Material

When two colliders are in contact, the physics system uses the **surface properties of each collider 
to calculate the total friction and bounce** between the two surfaces.

In Unity, you use the **Physic Material** asset to control these parameters. 
The Physic Material asset is represented in the API by the **`PhysicMaterial`** class.

 
The Physic Material adjusts friction and bouncing effects of colliding GameObjectsThe fundamental object 
in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, 
and more. A GameObjectâ€™s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.


The Physic Material asset provides two properties: \
**Friction Combine** (**`PhysicMaterial.frictionCombine`**) and **Bounce Combine** (**`PhysicMaterial.bounceCombine`**). 
These properties each provide four options to control how the physics system calculates the total friction and bounce between two colliders:



### Create and apply a custom Physic Material

You can create as many **custom Physic Material assets** as you need, and **apply them to colliders** in your scene.

Several colliders can have the same Physic Material asset assigned to them, and you can set a project-wide default to apply new default settings to all colliders in the project.


#### Create a custom Physic Material asset

To create a Physic Material asset, go to **Assets** > **Create** > **Physic Material**. By default, Unity places new Physic Material assets in your `Assets` directory.

> You can create as many custom Physic Material assets as you need. **Physic Material** assets have the file extension **`.physicMaterial`**.
