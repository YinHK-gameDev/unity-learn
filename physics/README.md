### Physics

Unity helps you simulate physics in your Project to ensure that the objects correctly accelerate and respond to collisions
, gravity, and various other forces. Unity provides different physics engine implementations which you can use according to your Project needs: **3D, 2D, object-oriented, or data-oriented**.

### Built-in physics engines for object-oriented projects
If your project is object-oriented, use the Unity’s built-in physics engine that corresponds to your needs:

- **Built-in 3D physics** (Nvidia PhysX engine integration)
- **Built-in 2D physics** (Box2D engine integration)


### Physics engine packages for data-oriented projects
If your project uses Unity’s Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS), you need to install a dedicated DOTS physics package. The available packages are:

- **Unity Physics package**: the DOTS physics engine you need to install by default to simulate physics in any data-oriented project.
- **Havok Physics for Unity package**: an implementation of the Havok physics engine for Unity, to use as an extension of the Unity Physics package. Note that this package is subject to a specific licensing scheme.
