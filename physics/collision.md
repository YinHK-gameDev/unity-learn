## collision

> If one Rigidbody collides with another, the **physics engine only calculates a collision if both GameObjects have a Collider attached**. If one GameObject **has a Rigidbody but no Collider, it passes through other GameObjects**, and Unity does not include it in collision calculations.

### collision vs trigger
OnTrigger is a **pass through collision**, where **objects donâ€™t bounce off each other**, but **events can be triggered** when contact is made. While collision like two objects collide in real world, they may bounce off. For example bullets and enemy use OnTrigger so the bullet doesnâ€™t bounce off the enemy and fly off.


### Temporarily ignore collision

There are several ways to do this, using a coroutine:

**Disabling the collider**
```cs
GetComponent<Collider>().enabled = false ;
StartCoroutine( EnableCollision( 3 ) ) ;

// ...

private IEnumerator EnableCollision( float delay )
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds( delay ) ;
    GetComponent<Collider>().enabled = true ;
}

```

**Turning the collider into a trigger**
```cs
GetComponent<Collider>().isTrigger = true ;
StartCoroutine( EnableCollision( 3 ) ) ;

// ...

private IEnumerator EnableCollision( float delay )
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds( delay ) ;
    GetComponent<Collider>().isTrigger = false;
}
```


**Changing the layer**

By scripting using Layermask:
```cs
gameObject.layer = LayerMask.NameToLayer("PhantomBall") ;
StartCoroutine( EnableCollision( 3 ) ) ;

// ...

private IEnumerator EnableCollision( float delay )
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds( delay ) ;
    gameObject.layer = LayerMask.NameToLayer("Ball") ;
}
```

Create different layer manually:
> ðŸ“Œ Set the two game objects into **different layers** â†’ **project setting** â†’ **physics** â†’ **Layer collision matrix** untick two layer for collision.


**Using Physics class**
```cs
Physics.IgnoreCollision( GetComponent<Collider>(), wallCollider, true ) ;
StartCoroutine( EnableCollision( 3 ) ) ;

// ...

private IEnumerator EnableCollision( float delay )
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds( delay ) ;
    Physics.IgnoreCollision( GetComponent<Collider>(), wallCollider, false ) ;
}
```

### Collision detection
Collision detection is the physics engine
â€™s process for detecting when a physics body (**Rigidbody** or **ArticulationBody**) comes into contact with a collider. Unity provides **different collision detection algorithms** for different situations, so that you can choose the most efficient approach for each individual physics body (**Rigidbody** or **Articulation Body**) in your scene.

**Collision Detection** defines which **algorithm** the physics body (Rigidbody or ArticulationBody) uses to **detect collisions**. Different algorithms offer **different levels of accuracy**, but more accurate algorithms require more **computational resource**s.

There are three algorithms available, represented by four collision detection modes:

| Collision detection mode | Algorithm | Useful for | Not useful for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Discrete** | Discrete | - Slow-moving collisions. | - Fast-moving collisions. |
| **Continuous Speculative** | Speculative CCD | - Fast-moving collisions. | - Some fast-moving collisions that require an especially high degree of accuracy. |
| **Continuous** | Sweep CCD | - Fast-moving linear collisions that require a high degree of accuracy.- Physics bodies that only collide with static colliders. | - Collisions that happen as a result of the physics body rotating.- Physics bodies that collide with moving colliders. |
| **Continuous Dynamic** | Sweep CCD | - Fast-moving linear collisions that require a high degree of accuracy.- Physics bodies that collide with moving colliders. | - Collisions that happen as a result of the physics body rotating. |
