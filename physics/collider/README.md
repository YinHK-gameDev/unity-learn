## collider

A collider is invisible, and does not need to be the exact same shape as the GameObjectâ€™s mesh. A rough approximation of the mesh is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay.

The simplest (and least processor-intensive) colliders are primitive collider types. In 3D, these are the **Box Collider**, **Sphere Collider** and **Capsule Collider**. In 2D, you can use the **Box Collider 2D** and **Circle Collider 2D**. **You can add any number of these to a single GameObject to create compound colliders**.
