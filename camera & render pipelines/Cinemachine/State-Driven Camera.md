## State-Driven Camera

The **Cinemachine State-Driven Camera** component activates a child Virtual Camera when an animation target changes states. For example, consider your avatarâ€™s local-motion system and orbit camera. Your game feels more alive to the player when the camera shakes more as your avatar runs. When the avatar walks, blend for example to a Virtual Camera with more damping.
