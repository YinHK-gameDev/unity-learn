## Cinemachine

Cinemachine is a suite of modules for operating the Unity camera. Cinemachine solves the **complex mathematics and logic of tracking targets, composing, blending, and cutting between shots**.

Cinemachine enables you to create complex 3D camera setups, allowing movement and cuts between multiple cameras.

It allows you to iterate and prototype new ideas on the fly while saving settings in play mode. From first-person shooter to follow cam, from 2D to 3D, from real-time play to cutscene

> Use the Unity Package Manager (in the top menu: **Window > Package Manager**) to select Cinemachine for installation.



### Virtual Cameras

Cinemachine does not create new cameras. Instead, it directs a single Unity camera for multiple shots. You compose these shots with **Virtual Cameras**. Virtual Cameras move and rotate the Unity camera and control its settings.

The Virtual Cameras are separate GameObjects from the Unity Camera, and behave independently. They are not nested within each other.
