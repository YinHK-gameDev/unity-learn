## Cinemachine

Cinemachine is a suite of modules for operating the Unity camera. Cinemachine solves the **complex mathematics and logic of tracking targets, composing, blending, and cutting between shots**.

Cinemachine enables you to create complex 3D camera setups, allowing movement and cuts between multiple cameras.

It allows you to iterate and prototype new ideas on the fly while saving settings in play mode. From first-person shooter to follow cam, from 2D to 3D, from real-time play to cutscene

> Use the Unity Package Manager (in the top menu: **Window > Package Manager**) to select Cinemachine for installation.
