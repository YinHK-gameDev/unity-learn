## Cinemachine ClearShot Camera component
The **Cinemachine ClearShot Camera component** chooses among its children Virtual Cameras for the best quality shot of the target. Use Clear Shot to set up complex multi-camera coverage of a Scene to guarantee a clear view of the target.

This can be a very powerful tool. Virtual Camera children with Cinemachine Collider extensions analyze the Scene for target obstructions, optimal target distance, and so on. Clear Shot uses this information to choose the best child to activate.
