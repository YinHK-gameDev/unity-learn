## Depth Textures

A Camera can generate a depth, depth+normals, or motion vector texture. This is a minimalistic G-buffer texture that can be used for post-processing effects or to implement custom lighting models (e.g. light pre-pass).
 
These are mostly used by effects; for example, post-processing effects often use depth information.
