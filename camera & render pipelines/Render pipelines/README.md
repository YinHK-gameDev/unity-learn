## Render pipelines
A render pipeline performs a series of operations that **take the contents of a Scene
, and displays them on a screen**.

In Unity, you can choose between different render pipelines. Unity provides three prebuilt render pipelines with different capabilities and performance characteristics, or you can create your own.
