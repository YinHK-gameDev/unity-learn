## Render pipelines
A render pipeline performs a series of **operations** that **take the contents of a Scene
, and displays them on a screen**.

These operations are:

- Culling
- Rendering
- Post-processing

In Unity, you can choose between different render pipelines. Unity provides three prebuilt render pipelines with different capabilities and performance characteristics, or you can create your own.


It can be difficult to switch a Project from one render pipeline to another, because different render pipelines use different shader
 outputs, and might not have the same features. It is therefore important to understand the different render pipelines that Unity provides
