## Custom Pass
A Custom Pass controls how Unity renders the objects in a scene. You can configure a Custom Pass using a Custom Pass Volume. Custom pass Volumes function in a similar way to HDRP Volumes. A Custom Pass allows you to do the following:

- Change the appearance of materials in your scene.
- Change the order that Unity renders GameObjects in.
- Allows Unity to read camera buffers to shaders.

For example, you can use a Custom Pass to blur the background of a cameraâ€™s view while the in-game UI is visible.
