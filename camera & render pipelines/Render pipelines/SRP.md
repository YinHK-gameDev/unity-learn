## Scriptable Render Pipeline

The **Scriptable Render Pipeline** is a thin API layer that lets you schedule and configure rendering commands using C# scripts
. Unity passes these commands to its low-level graphics architecture, which then sends instructions to the graphics API.

**URP** and **HDRP** are built on top of **SRP**. You can also create your own custom render pipeline on top of **SRP**.

**Every render pipeline based on SRP has two key customized elements:**

### Render Pipeline Instance and Render Pipeline Asset
- A **Render Pipeline Instance**. 
  This is an instance of a class defines the functionality of your render pipeline. Its script inherits from **`RenderPipeline`**, and overrides its **`Render()`** method.
- A **Render Pipeline Asset**. This is an asset in your Unity Project that stores data about which Render Pipeline Instance to use, and how to configure it. Its script inherits from **`RenderPipelineAsset`** and overrides its **`CreatePipeline()`** method.


###  `ScriptableRenderContext`
**`ScriptableRenderContext`** is a class that acts as an interface between the custom C# code in the render pipeline and Unityâ€™s low-level graphics code.

### Entry points and callbacks
When working with SRP, use these to make Unity call your C# code at specific times.

- **`RenderPipeline.Render`** is the main entry point to the SRP. Unity calls this method automatically. If you are writing a custom render pipeline, this is where you begin to write your code.
- The **`RenderPipelineManager`** class has the following events that you can subscribe to, so that you can execute custom code at specific points in the render loop:
  - **`beginFrameRendering`** - **Note**: This can generate garbage. Use **`beginContextRendering`** instead.
  - **`endFrameRendering`** - **Note**: This can generate garbage. Use **`endContextRendering`** instead.
- **`beginContextRendering`**
- **`endContextRendering`**
- **`beginCameraRendering`**
- **`endCameraRendering`**
