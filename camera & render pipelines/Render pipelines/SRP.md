## Scriptable Render Pipeline

The **Scriptable Render Pipeline** is a thin API layer that lets you schedule and configure rendering commands using C# scripts
. Unity passes these commands to its low-level graphics architecture, which then sends instructions to the graphics API.

**URP** and **HDRP** are built on top of **SRP**. You can also create your own custom render pipeline on top of **SRP**.
