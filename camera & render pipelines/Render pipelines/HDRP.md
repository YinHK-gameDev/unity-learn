## High Definition Render Pipeline

The High Definition Render Pipeline(HDRP) is a prebuilt Scriptable Render Pipeline, built by Unity. HDRP lets you create cutting-edge, high-fidelity graphics for high-end platforms.
 
Use HDRP for AAA quality games, automotive demos, architectural applications and anything that requires high-fidelity graphics. HDRP uses physically-based lighting and materials, and supports both forward and deferred rendering. HDRP uses compute shader technology and therefore requires compatible GPU hardware.
 
HDRP utilizes physically based Lighting techniques, linear lighting, HDR lighting, and a configurable hybrid Tile/Cluster deferred/Forward lighting architecture. It gives you the tools you need to create applications such as games, technical demos, and animations to a high graphical standard.


> Note: Projects that you make with HDRP aren't compatible with the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). You must decide which render pipeline your Project uses before you start development; HDRP features aren't cross-compatible between HDRP and URP.
