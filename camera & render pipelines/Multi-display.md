## Multi-display
You can use multi-display to display up to eight different Camera views of your application on up to eight different monitors at the same time. 

Unity’s default display mode is one monitor only. When you run your application, you need use **`Display.Activate()`** to explicitly activate additional displays. Once you activate a display, you can’t deactivate it.
