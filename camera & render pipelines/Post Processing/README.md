## Post Processing
Post-processing is a generic term for a full-screen image processing effect that occurs after the camera draws the scene but before the scene is rendered on the screen. Post-processing can drastically improve the visuals of your product with little setup time.

You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties.
