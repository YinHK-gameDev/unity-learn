## Post Processing
Post-processing is a generic term for a **full-screen image processing effect** that **occurs after the camera draws the scene but before the scene is rendered on the screen**. \
Post-processing can drastically **improve the visuals of your product** with little setup time.

You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties.
