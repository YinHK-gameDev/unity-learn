## Dynamic resolution

Dynamic resolution is a Camera setting that allows you to dynamically scale individual render targets, to reduce workload on the GPU. In cases where the applicationâ€™s frame rate reduces, you can gradually scale down the resolution to maintain a consistent frame rate instead. Unity triggers this scaling if performance data suggests that the frame rate is about to decrease as a result of the application being GPU-bound. You can also trigger the scaling manually by preempting a particularly GPU-intensive section of the application and controlling the scaling via a script. If scaled gradually, dynamic resolution can be almost unnoticeable.
 
 
**Note:** 
- The Built-in Render Pipeline, and the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) both support dynamic resolution as described in this document.
- The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) supports dynamic resolution, but you enable and use it in a different way. For information on dynamic resolution in HDRP, see Dynamic resoluton in HDRP.
