## Dynamic resolution

Dynamic resolution is a Camera setting that allows you to dynamically scale individual render targets, to reduce workload on the GPU. In cases where the applicationâ€™s frame rate reduces, you can gradually scale down the resolution to maintain a consistent frame rate instead. Unity triggers this scaling if performance data suggests that the frame rate is about to decrease as a result of the application being GPU-bound. You can also trigger the scaling manually by preempting a particularly GPU-intensive section of the application and controlling the scaling via a script. If scaled gradually, dynamic resolution can be almost unnoticeable.
